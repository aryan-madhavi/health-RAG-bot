DENTAL CAVITIES
Dental cavitiesAlso known as Cavities, Tooth decay, and Dental caries
OVERVIEW
Overview
Dental cavities are one of the most widespread oral health problems affecting people of all ages. They develop when mouth bacteria break down sugars and starches from food and drinks, releasing acids that slowly wear away the enamel, the protective outer layer of your teeth. Over time, this damage can lead to holes (cavities), pain, infection, or even tooth loss if not treated.


Symptoms can include tooth sensitivity, visible holes or pits, toothache, or pain while eating or drinking something sweet, hot, or cold. Sometimes, early decay may not cause any symptoms at all.


Poor oral hygiene, frequent snacking on sugary or acidic foods and drinks, dry mouth, and not getting regular dental checkups increase the risk of dental cavities. Children and older adults are especially vulnerable.


The good news is that dental cavities are largely preventable. Brushing twice daily with fluoride toothpaste, flossing, reducing sugar intake, and seeing a dentist regularly can keep cavities at bay. Management depends on the severity of the decay; it may involve fillings, or, in advanced cases, root canal treatment.

TYPES OF DENTAL CAVITIES
Types Of Dental Cavities

Cavities can affect different parts of a tooth and may look or feel different depending on where they develop. Here are the main types:

Pit and fissure cavities:These form in the grooves on the chewing surfaces of back teeth where food often gets stuck.

Smooth surface cavities:These are found on the flat sides of teeth, usually between teeth, where plaque can build up if not cleaned well.

Root cavities:These occur on the tooth roots, which can become exposed due to gum recession (shrinking gums), more common in older adults or those with gum disease.Did You Know?
Gum recession isn’t just an “old age” issue.Brushing too hard or using a hard-bristled toothbrush can wear your gums down over time. Once gums recede, they don’t grow back naturally, which is why gentle care matters!

CAUSES OF DENTAL CAVITIES
Causes Of Dental Cavities

Dental cavities begin when bacteria in your mouth, especiallyStreptococcus mutans, feed on sugars from food and drinks.
When we eat sugary or starchy foods, bacteria in the sticky film (plaque) on our teeth feed on these sugars and release acids, especiallylactic acid.
These acids lower the pH around the teeth, slowly dissolving the protective outer layer calledenamel.
Over time, repeated acid attacks cause tiny holes or soft spots in the enamel.
If untreated, the decay can spread deeper into the tooth, reaching thedentin (the softer layer beneath) and eventually the pulp (which contains nerves and blood vessels),leading to pain or infection.

DIAGNOSIS OF DENTAL CAVITIES
Diagnosis Of Dental Cavities

Early and accurate diagnosis is key to preventing the progression of dental cavities. Diagnosis consists of:

1. CLINICAL EXAMINATION
1. Clinical examination
Dentists use visual inspection to check for white spots, discoloration, pits, or cavities.

Tactile examination, also known as percussion, is done using a dental explorer and may help assess surface texture and identify sticky areas indicating early decay.

2. RADIOGRAPHIC EXAMINATION
2. Radiographic examination

Bitewing X-rays:These are the most common method to detect cavities in between the teeth. It is used to assess the extent of deeper lesions.

Periapical x-rays:These may be used for more extensive views in some cases.

X-ray Orthopantomogram(OPG):This is a panoramic dental X-ray that captures the entire mouth in a single image and helps detect deep or widespread dental cavities.

3. LASER FLUORESCENCE DEVICES (E.G.DIAGNODENT)
3. Laser fluorescence devices (e.g.DIAGNOdent)

These tools use light to spot early tooth damage that isn’t visible yet, helping detect cavities before they get worse.

4. FIBER-OPTIC TRANSILLUMINATION (FOTI)
4. Fiber-optic transillumination (FOTI)

Light is used to detect changes in tooth density; helpful in detecting caries between teeth or cracks.

5. QUANTITATIVE LIGHT-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE (QLF)
5. Quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF)

It helps catch cavities early by tracking how tooth minerals are lost over time.

PREVENTION OF DENTAL CAVITIES
Prevention Of Dental Cavities

Dental caries are preventable with the right approaches and techniques. Here are a few tips that can help:

WATCH WHAT YOU EAT
Watch what you eat
Your diet plays a big role in cavity preventionAvoid sticky sweets, candies, sugary drinks, and frequent snackingReducing sugar intake, especially between meals, lowers acid attacks and helps prevent cavitiesChoose tooth-friendly foods like fresh fruits, crunchy vegetables, cheese, yogurt, and whole grainsDrink more water to rinse away food particles and neutralize acids.

PRIORITIZE DENTAL CHECKUPS
Prioritize dental checkups
Regular dental checkups can spot cavities early, before they worsenProfessional cleaning removes plaque and tartar buildup that daily brushing can miss, preventing decay and gum issuesYou can get tips tailored to your oral health

How often should you see a dentist?

Children:Withinsix months of the eruption of the first tooth, or by the age of one year, whichever comes first.

Adults:At leastonce a year, or twice yearlyif you're at higher risk, like dry mouth, diabetes, or a history of cavities.
USE FLUORIDE


Use fluoride
Fluoride helps repair early enamel damage by encouraging enamel formationUse a fluoride toothpaste and mouthwash along with flossing for better protection.



Protip: Use mouthwash after brushing and flossing. Swish it for 30–60 seconds without swallowing, and avoid eating or drinking for 30 minutes afterward. Safeguard your smile.

TREATMENT OF DENTAL CAVITIES
Treatment Of Dental Cavities

Dental cavities don’t heal independently, but early-stage decay can be reversed with the right care. Treatment of dental caries consists of:

MINIMALLY INVASIVE TREATMENTS
Minimally invasive treatments

Fillings:When a cavity forms, the decayed portion of the tooth is removed and replaced with a restorative material (like composite resin or amalgam) to bring back the tooth’s normal shape and function.

Glass ionomer restorations:These are gentle, tooth-colored fillings that slowly release fluoride, helping protect against further decay. They’re especially useful for children, older adults, or areas where moisture control is difficult.



Laser therapy:Low-level lasers and light-activated systems have been explored for anti-caries effects and enamel remineralization.



MODERATELY INVASIVE TREATMENT
Moderately invasive treatment

Root canal treatment (RCT):If the decay reaches the tooth’s pulp (nerve), a root canal is done to remove infected tissue, clean the canals, and seal the tooth. A crown is usually required after RCT to strengthen and protect the now brittle tooth structure from breaking.

Crowns:A crown (or cap) is a tooth-shaped cover placed over a damaged or root canal–treated tooth to restore strength, function, and appearance. It is commonly used when a large part of the tooth is compromised.




SURGICAL TREATMENT
Surgical treatment

Tooth removal (extraction):If a tooth is severely damaged or infected beyond repair, it may need to be surgically extracted. This may be followed by options like bridges, dentures, or implants to replace the missing tooth.



NEWER APPROACHES
Newer approaches

Resin infiltration:A minimally invasive method where a special resin fills early enamel cavities without drilling, helping to stop decay in its tracks.



Chemo-mechanical caries removal:Uses a gel to soften decayed material, allowing dentists to remove cavities gently without drilling.




Note: Dental caries can cause toothaches ranging from mild sensitivity to intense, throbbing pain. Over-the-counter painkillers likeparacetamoloribuprofencan help ease the discomfort temporarily.

COMPLICATIONS OF DENTAL CAVITIES
Complications Of Dental Cavities

If left untreated, dental cavities can lead to complications that can affect your overall health. Complications can include:

LOCAL COMPLICATIONS
Local complications

Dental pain:It is a common complication of dental caries, caused by nerve irritation or infection as decay progresses deeper into the tooth.

Apical periodontitis:Inflammation around the tip of a tooth root, usually due to pulp infection.

Periapical abscess:A pus-filled pocket at the root tip caused by bacterial infection.

Periapical granuloma:A mass of inflamed tissue at the root tip from chronic irritation.

Periapical cyst:A fluid-filled sac near the root apex, often developing from a granuloma.

Abscess:A localized collection of pus due to infection.

Periostitis:Inflammation of the periosteum, the tissue surrounding bone, often causing pain and swelling.

Osteomyelitis:A serious bone infection that can result from untreated dental infections.

Malocclusion:Decay can alter bite alignment, leading to crooked teeth, especially in children.

Tooth fracture:It can occur when decay weakens the tooth structure, making it prone to breaking.

Tooth loss:Progressive decay can destroy the tooth structure, requiring tooth removal.

SYSTEMIC COMPLICATIONS
Systemic complications

Difficulty eating or speaking:Pain and tooth damage can impair chewing and speech.

Facial cellulitis:Untreated infections can spread to facial tissues, causing swelling, redness, andfever.

Sinusitis:It can develop when advanced dental caries in upper teeth spread to the nearby sinuses, causing inflammation or infection.

Systemic infections:Bacteria from an infected tooth can enter the bloodstream and affect organs (e.g., endocarditis).

Reduced quality of life:Ongoing discomfort, bad breath, and cosmetic concerns may affect self-esteem and daily activities.
