HEMOPHILIA
HemophiliaAlso known as Classical hemophilia, Factor VIII deficiency & Hemophilia A
OVERVIEW
Overview

Hemophilia is a genetic disorder that affects the blood’s ability to clot, leading to excessive bleeding from even minor injuries. It’s caused by a deficiency in certain clotting factors, often inherited from parents.

The signs and symptoms include unexplained GI bleeding, blood in urine, nosebleeds, excessive bruising, heavy and prolonged menstrual and painful and swollen joints. The prolonged bleeding is also seen during dental extractions, any type of surgery, injury, and even after using needles for infusing medications or vaccines.

The primary risk factor for hemophilia is having a family history of the disorder, as it’s typically inherited. Males are more likely to develop hemophilia since the gene responsible is carried on the X chromosome.

Hemophilia requires lifelong management with factor concentrates, regular testing, joint care, and maintaining overall health to improve quality of life.

TYPES OF HEMOPHILIA
Types Of Hemophilia

Hemophilia can be classified into the following types:
BASED ON CAUSE
Based On Cause
1. Hemophilia A (classical hemophilia):It is caused due to the deficiency or a complete absence of Factor VIII. It is more common than hemophilia B.

2. Hemophilia B (Christmas disease):Deficiency or lack of factor IX causes hemophilia B.

Note:HA and HB are indistinguishable as both have the same clinical symptoms.


BASED ON SEVERITY
Based On Severity
HA and HB can also be classified according to the plasma level of FVIII or FIX activity. It can be classified as:


1. Mild:Hemophilia is considered mild if the level of clotting factor VIII or IX is between 5 to 40%. Individuals with mild deficiency generally experience bleeding after serious injury and trauma.

Note:Women with mild hemophilia can experience heavy menstrual bleeding. These women can suffer from extensive vaginal bleeding after childbirth.


Here are some other abnormal causes of vaginal bleeding.
Tap To Know

3. Moderate:The moderate form has a factor level of 1-5% in the blood. These people tend to have episodes of bleeding after injuries.

4. Severe:The activity level of less than 1% is considered severe hemophilia. The occurrence of frequent spontaneous bleeding into the joints, muscles, and soft tissues without the cause is the classical sign of severe injury.
Have you heard about hemophilia C?
Hemophilia C is a rare type, affecting 1 in 100,000 men and women equally. Caused by a deficiency in factor XI, it typically has milder symptoms without spontaneous internal bleeding, often going unnoticed throughout life.

SYMPTOMS OF HEMOPHILIA
Symptoms Of Hemophilia

People with hemophilia bleed longer than other people. The symptoms of hemophilia include:

Spontaneous bleeding to joints, muscles, and soft tissues
Bleeding into the joint cavity
Prolonged bleeding after surgery or trauma
Unexplained bleeding in the digestive tract
Blood in urine or stool
Nosebleeds
Excessive bruising
Presence of hematoma (clots)
Extensive bleeding after childbirth
Heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding
Painful and swollen joints (most commonly affected joints are knees, elbows, ankles, shoulders, wrists, and hips)
Restricted motion of joints
Abdominal pain
Unexplained irritability in babies, often due to internal bleeding
CAUSES OF HEMOPHILIA
Causes Of Hemophilia

Hemophilia is a genetic disease that is characterized by the absence or deficiency of certain clotting factors from birth. The possible reason for these alterations can be:

Inheritance (passed from parent to child)
Mutation (change in the DNA sequence)

The clotting factors that are involved in the pathophysiology of hemophilia are FVIII, FIX, and XI.Did you know hemophilia primarily affects males?
The males have one X and one Y chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes. Hemophilia is an “X” linked disease. It affects majorly males as women have another healthy X chromosome.
RISK FACTORS FOR HEMOPHILIA
Risk Factors For Hemophilia

The following factors increase the risk of hemophilia:
FAMILY HISTORY
Family history
Hemophilia runs in families. It is strongly associated with a positive family history.

Interesting Tidbit!
Hemophilia is often called "the royal disease" due to its prevalence in European royal families in the 19th and 20th centuries. Queen Victoria of England is believed to have been a carrier of hemophilia B, passing it down to her descendants.

GENDER
Gender
Males are more prone to hemophilia.
Baby boys born to hemophilic parents or who have had family members with hemophilia are recommended to be tested soon after the birth.
RACE
Race
People in regions where consanguineous marriages, like in Egypt, are common have a higher chance of developing hemophilia.
Additionally, Ashkenazi Jews are more likely to have factor XI deficiency, known as hemophilia C.Did you know?
Hemophilia and anemia are different conditions, but they can be linked. Hemophilia, a bleeding disorder, can cause excessive bleeding, which may lead to anemia due to blood loss. Understand symptoms of anemia better.Read This Now
DIAGNOSIS OF HEMOPHILIA
Diagnosis Of Hemophilia

Hemophilia should be diagnosed in individuals with a family history of the condition or who exhibit potential symptoms. The diagnosis consists of the following:
1. SCREENING TESTS
1. Screening tests
The screening tests consist of simple blood tests to check the level of blood clotting. These include:

Complete blood count:Individuals with hemophilia have a normal CBC. However, prolonged bleeding can cause a decrease in the level of hemoglobin.
Bleeding time:It measures the time taken by the blood to clot after bleeding. It is often normal in hemophilia.
Prothrombin time:PT is the time in seconds that it takes plasma to clot. It is usually normal in case of hemophilia.
Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT):It measures the blood's ability to clot in hemophilia. APTT is typically prolonged due to deficiencies in clotting factors.


2. FACTOR ASSAYS
2. Factor assays
These tests determine the activity of the clotting factors. There are three types of factor assays for hemophilia:
Factor VIII(hemophilia A)
Factor IX(hemophilia B)
Factor XI(hemophilia C)

3. PRENATAL TESTING
3. Prenatal testing
Prenatal testing is done by two methods:
CVS (chorionic villous sampling): In this, a sample of tissue is taken from the placenta to test for genetic abnormalities.
Amniocentesis: It involves an examination of amniotic fluid (fluid around the baby).

Note:Pregnant women should undergo detection of  hemophilia in the developing baby if they:
Are hemophilic
Has another child who has hemophilia
Has symptoms of hemophilia

These tests should be done between weeks 8 to10.

Here are some medical tests that are a must during pregnancy.

4. IMAGING TESTS
4. Imaging tests
These are done to check for internal bleeding. The tests recommended are:
CT scan of the headorMRI of the brain:To rule out intracranial bleeding
Ultrasonography of joints:Recommended in individuals with recurrent joint bleed
CT scanorMRIof the chest:To detect bleeding in the chest
CECT scanorMRI of the abdomen:To check for abdominal bleeds

TREATMENT OF HEMOPHILIA
Treatment Of Hemophilia

Hemophilia can not be cured due to its genetic nature. The treatment focuses on replacing the missing protein and eliminating the bleeds associated with the disorder. Management consists of:
MANAGEMENT OF BLEEDING
Management of bleeding
It includes controlling bleeding in the suspected or confirmed cases.
It includes an infusion of factor concentrates and entire blood as per the need and availability. Bleeding should be ceased within two hours of the onset of symptoms to avoid complications.

Here are some tips to stop bleeding.

PROPHYLACTIC MANAGEMENT (REGULAR TREATMENT REGIMEN)
Prophylactic management (regular treatment regimen)
It involves treatment options that are aimed at preventing episodes of bleeding.
It is typically prescribed to individuals with severe hemophilia.
The regular intravenous (IV) infusion of the missing clotting factors is given to increase their level.


FACTOR CONCENTRATES
Factor concentrates
Plasma-derived:They are prepared from the donor blood. It is used to control spontaneous bleeding due to its rapid action. A common example ishuman coagulation factor VIII.

Recombinant factors:Plasma-derived products are more susceptible to viral infections (HIV and hepatitis). To overcome this recombinant clotting factors are used which serve the same purpose.

BLOOD TRANSFUSION
Blood transfusion
The whole blood is also used to control bleeding as it contains all the clotting factors.


ADJUVANT THERAPIES
Adjuvant therapies
Tranexamic acid: It works by blocking the breakdown of blood clots, which prevents bleeding. It is mainly used to control mucosal bleeding.

Desmopressin (DDAVP):It works by releasing stored Factor VIII from blood vessels. It is used mainly in mild hemophilia.

Fibrin sealant:It is available as sprays that are meant to be applied on open wounds to control bleeding.

Factor eight inhibitor bypassing activity (FEIBA):It is composed of the clotting factors  II, VII, IX, and X.

Antispasmodic analgesics:These are used to control pain during the bleeding episode. The common examples are
Paracetamol
Dextropropoxyphene
Codeine
Buprenorphine
Tramadol

Aminocaproic acid:It prevents blood clots and is mainly prescribed before dental surgery. It is also given to manage nose and mouth bleeds.

Calcium alginate:It is derived from seaweed and is used in dressings of wound repair.

NOVEL THERAPIES
Novel therapies
Gene therapy:A gene is a basic unit of information that directs cells to produce proteins; gene therapy aims to correct diseases by introducing functional genes, though it's costly and has limited application.

Monoclonal antibodies (non-factor replacement therapies):They are proteins made in labs that work in the same manner as that of the body's protein. One available therapy isemicizumab.

Hemostatic rebalancing therapies:These aim to restore the natural balance in blood clotting by correcting deficiencies or imbalances. Some examples include:
Fitusiran
Concizumab

COMPLICATIONS OF HEMOPHILIA
Complications Of Hemophilia

The major complication with hemophilia is developing antibodies against the factors given externally.
It is estimated that around 15 to 20% of people develop the inhibitors. It makes the treatment extremely difficult.
THE OTHER COMPLICATIONS INCLUDE:
The other complications include:
Musculoskeletal deformities:Affecting joints, ankles, knees, and elbows.
Pseudotumors:these are tumor-like structures that contain coagulated blood and are surrounded by a thick wall. They mostly develop in long bones and the pelvis.
Fractures:Chronic and severe joint impairment as a result of bleeding can also lead to fractures.
Bloodborne infection: Individuals can also develop blood borne infections such as HIV infection and hepatitis C due to the infusion of contaminated blood and factor concentrates.
