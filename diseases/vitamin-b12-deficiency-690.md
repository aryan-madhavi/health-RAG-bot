VITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY
Vitamin B12 deficiencyAlso known as Cobalamin deficiency
OVERVIEW
Overview

Vitamin B12 is an important nutrient that helps the body make new red blood cells and DNA (genetic material of the cells) along with keeping nerve cells healthy.

Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to anemia, fatigue, muscle weakness, nerve damage, and cognitive issues and other symptoms.

This vitamin is naturally found in only animal products like eggs, meat, fish, and dairy. Its deficiency is often caused by poor dietary intake of these items.

Vitamin B12 also needs a special agent called "intrinsic factor" for it to be absorbed. Conditions, such as pernicious anemia, celiac disease, and crohn's disease, and surgeries like gastric bypass that interfere with the absorption of vitamin B12 can also cause its deficiency.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is mostly preventable. Consume a balanced diet that includes a healthy mix of animal products. If you are following a vegetarian diet, you can eat products that are fortified with vitamin B12 or take a daily oral supplement.

Severe deficiency can be managed by I.V. B12 injections and addressing underlying causes like gastrointestinal disorders.

CAUSES OF VITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY
Causes Of Vitamin B12 deficiency

Vitamin B12 is naturally found only in animal products like eggs, meat, fish, and dairy.
It adheres to the proteins in these food items, and then hydrochloric acid and enzymes in the stomach release it into its free form.
It also needs a special agent called "intrinsic factor" to be absorbed in the small intestine.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is caused by a lack of dietary intake or problems in its absorption. The various risk factors associated with these causes are discussed in the next section.
RISK FACTORS FOR VITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY
Risk Factors For Vitamin B12 deficiency
1. INADEQUATE DIETARY INTAKE

1. Inadequate dietary intake
Animal-based foods, such as meat, fish, eggs, poultry and dairy products, are high in vitamin B12. Deficiency is usually seen in:
Adults: Vegans and vegetarians who do not consume these items
Infants: Breastfeeding in infants with vitamin B12-deficient mothers
Malnourishment

2. INSUFFICIENT ABSORPTION
2. Insufficient absorption
This is the most common cause of vitamin B12 insufficiency. The following factors can contribute to insufficient absorption:
Lack of intrinsic factor (a protein made in the stomach needed to absorb vitamin B12)Pernicious anemia (an autoimmune condition in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the cells in the stomach that produce the ‘intrinsic factor’)Gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining leading to insufficient hydrochloric acid, which is required for vitamin B12 absorption)Decreased stomach acid (common among older people)Gastric bypass surgeryWeight loss surgeries (bariatric surgery)Bacterial overgrowth in the small intestineFish tapeworm infectionCertain medications such asMetformin (used to treat diabetes)Proton pump inhibitors (used to treat GERD and peptic ulcers)Histamine H2 blockers (used to reduce the amount of acid the stomach produces)Oral contraceptives (oral birth control pills)HIV infection

3. INCREASED REQUIREMENT
3. Increased requirement
In certain circumstances, your body may have increased requirements for folate, which can lead to a deficiency if you are unable to meet these demands. These include:

Pregnancy
Breastfeeding
Hyperthyroidism
Infancy
Malignancy (cancer)

4.  CONDITIONS
4.  Conditions
Crohn’s disease
Celiac disease
Diabetes
Sjögren's syndrome
Blood disorders like sickle cell anemia (an inherited condition affecting the abnormal development of red blood cells)
Battling an infection or health condition characterized by high inflammation

Note:Premature babies (born before the 37th week of pregnancy) are also more likely to develop a folate deficiency because their developing bodies require higher amounts of folate than normal.
5. AGE

5. Age
Being an older adult because of poor nutrition, memory loss, rigid diet, or lack of access to care.

6. FAMILY HISTORY
6. Family history
A family history of conditions like pernicious anemia can be a risk factor for vitamin B12 deficiency due to genetic predisposition.

DIAGNOSIS OF VITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY
Diagnosis Of Vitamin B12 deficiency

Vitamin B12 deficiency can be diagnosed through a combination of clinical symptoms, medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Here are the steps involved in diagnosing vitamin B12 deficiency:

1. MEDICAL HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
1. Medical history and physical examination

Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms, medical history, and any relevant factors such as your diet and lifestyle. They will also perform a physical examination to check for signs associated with vitamin B12 deficiency.


2. LABORATORY TESTS
2. Laboratory tests
Serum vitamin B12 test:It measures the total amount of vitamin B12 in your blood, including both active and inactive forms.


Complete blood count (CBC):It measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to anemia, and a CBC can help determine if your red blood cell count is low.


Holotranscobalamin (holoTC) test:It measures the active form of vitamin B12 in the blood. It is done to assess B12 deficiency more accurately.


Functional markers of B12:These include testingmethyl malonic acid (MMA)andhomocysteinelevels to evaluate vitamin B12 deficiency. Elevated MMA and homocysteine levels indicate potential B12 deficiency-related health risks.


RBC folate test:It is a blood test that measures the level of folate (a B vitamin) stored in red blood cells. It is sometimes done alongside vitamin B12 testing because low folate levels can mimic the symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency.


Antibodies tointrinsic factorsandparietal cells:These are blood tests used to diagnose the autoimmune condition pernicious anemia, a common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency.


Serum gastrin test:These are checked in vitamin B12 deficiency to assess gastric health and rule out pernicious anemia, as abnormal levels may indicate autoimmune gastritis, which can lead to B12 malabsorption.

3. IMAGING TESTS
3. Imaging tests
X-rays:These can be used to assess bone density, which can be affected in severe cases of B12 deficiency, leading to conditions likeosteoporosis.


Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):It can be used to examine the brain and spinal cord, particularly if symptoms like numbness, tingling, or balance problems. It can help identify structural changes that might be related to B12 deficiency.


Endoscopy:It involves the use of a flexible viewing tube to directly examine internal structures. It may be done to check for the destruction of stomach cells that produce intrinsic factors.Book your tests with Tata 1mg
