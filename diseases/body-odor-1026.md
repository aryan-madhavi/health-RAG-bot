BODY ODOR
Body OdorAlso known as bromhidrosis, osmidrosis and ozochrotia
OVERVIEW
Overview
Body odor is a reasonably common condition. Most cases are related to poor personal hygiene orexcessive sweating. However, in some instances, it may be a symptom of underlying conditions, such as hormonal imbalance, dietary factors, stress, and anxiety.

Body odor results from the interaction between sweat and bacteria on the skin. Sweat itself is odorless, but when it mingles with bacteria on the skin's surface, particularly in warm and moist areas, the bacteria break down the sweat components into substances that emit an unpleasant smell.

Prevention includes maintaining body hygiene, wearing clean, breathable attire, optimum hydration, and managing stress. Management involves using antiperspirants, deodorants, antibacterial soaps, and topical antibiotics. Severe cases may require underarm botox or other surgical procedures.

SYMPTOMS OF BODY ODOR
Symptoms Of Body Odor

The main symptom is noticeable and often includes offensive odor, but other symptoms may vary depending on the cause and factors involved. Here are the common symptoms and characteristics associated with body odor:
1. UNPLEASANT SMELL
1. Unpleasant smell
The most prominent symptom is the presence of a foul or unpleasant odor, often described as pungent, musky, or rotten.
2. EXACERBATION WITH SWEATING
2. Exacerbation with sweating
One of the key factors that intensifies body odor is sweating. When a person sweats, it creates a moist environment that allows bacteria on the skin's surface to break down sweat and produce odor. Understanding this relationship can provide readers with a deeper understanding of the condition.

Here are 5 common reasons for excessive sweating.

3. Discoloration of clothing
Body odor can sometimes lead to yellowish or brownish stains on clothing, particularly in the underarm area.
4. ITCHINESS OR SKIN IRRITATION
4. Itchiness or skin irritation
Excessive sweating and bacterial growth can sometimes lead to skin irritation,itching, or even a rash in the affected areas.
CAUSES OF BODY ODOR
Causes Of Body Odor

Before understanding the exact cause behind body odor, it is important to know about sweat glands and their function:
WHAT ARE SWEAT GLANDS?
What are sweat glands?
Sweat glands are small tubular structures of the skin that produce sweat. They are of two types:
1. ECCRINE
1. Eccrine
Present throughout the body, most prominently on the soles of the feet, palms, forehead, cheeks, and in the armpits
Help in maintaining the body temperature
Produce large volumes of watery, usually odorless sweat
2. APOCRINE
2. Apocrine
Connected to the hair follicles situated in the groin and axillary regions
Begin functioning during puberty in response to the activation of sex hormones.
Secretes a thick, viscous, usually invisible fluid that produces a characteristic potent smell when it comes in contact with skin bacteria
Usually, the apocrine sweat and bacteria get washed away by regular (eccrine) sweat, which doesn't stink.


WHAT CAUSES BODY ODOR?
What causes body odor?
Body odor is caused by the contact between sweat and bacteria that reside on the skin. It can be due to:
The presence of a large amount of bacteria on the skin
Excessive production of apocrine sweat


These two processes can be triggered by several factors discussed under the “risk factors” section.

Apart from sweat(skin), the odorous substances can also be emitted through:
Saliva
Breath
Reproductive fluids
Urine

5. HORMONAL CHANGES
5. Hormonal changes
Hormonal fluctuations, such as those occurring during puberty, menstruation, or menopause, can affect sweat composition and increase bacterial activity, contributing to more pungent body odor.
6. EXCESSIVE SWEATING
6. Excessive sweating
Excessive sweating, known as hyperhidrosis, can lead to increased moisture on the skin's surface, providing more material for bacteria to metabolize and produce a more pungent odor.
7. DIETARY FACTORS
7. Dietary factors
Certain foods, such as garlic, onions, spices, and alcohol, can influence the odor of sweat because their components are released through sweat.
8. GENETICS
8. Genetics
Genetics can influence an individual's unique body odor profile, making some people more prone to producing certain odors.

Clindamycin
Erythromycin
3. BOTOX INJECTIONS
3. Botox injections
For severe cases of underarm sweating, Botox injections can be considered. Botox blocks the nerves, stimulating sweat glands and reducing sweat production in the treated area.
4. IONTOPHORESIS
4. Iontophoresis
A small electric current is passed through the skin to reduce sweating. This method is used when excessive eccrine sweat contributes to body odor.
5. SURGERY
5. Surgery
There are two approaches:
A. Localized destruction:In this, surgeries are performed to destroy sweat glands. These procedures can only be done in the armpit areas. It involves:
Liposuction:Sweat glands are present in the layer of fat under the skin. This method involves removing that layer using a suction device. Due to superior results and fewer risks, this method is now mostly replaced by botox injections.
Laser:Fat under which the sweat glands are present is liquified using laser energy. The debris of sweat glands and fat are later removed by liposuction.
Curettage:During this procedure, the undersurface of the skin (which contains sweat glands) is scraped using a suction tube and curette.


B. ETS (endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy):It includes the removal of nerves that cause sweating.
