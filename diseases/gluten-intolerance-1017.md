GLUTEN INTOLERANCE
Gluten IntoleranceAlso known as gluten sensitivity, Non-celiac gluten sensitivity and NCGS
OVERVIEW
Overview
You must have heard about many gluten free food products available in the market. Gluten is basically a hard-to-digest plant protein, commonly found in our everyday food grains like wheat, rye and barley. It is used in staples like parathas and rotis, white and brown bread, cakes, cookies and biscuits, pizza, burger, pasta, sauces like soy sauce and tomato ketchup, ice-cream and beer.


Gluten intolerance is a condition that is characterized by symptoms such asbloating, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea and flatulence upon consumption of gluten.


The condition is not treatable and can only be managed by adopting a gluten free dietary regimen. Grains like wheat and barley contain essential nutrients like iron, Vitamin B, folic acid and dietary fiber. Hence, it is important to compensate for these nutrients through other dietary options and supplements.

CAUSES OF GLUTEN INTOLERANCE
Causes Of Gluten Intolerance

Gluten is a type of protein that is majorly found in wheat. The other sources include rye, barley, and oats.
WHAT CAUSES GLUTEN ALLERGY?
What causes gluten allergy?
Proteins are normally digested by the enzymes present in the stomach.
Gluten is, however, not digested completely by these enzymes due to the high content of indigestible protein in it.
The undigested gluten usually goes into the small intestine. It stays in the body for 1-2 days after which it is excreted with other waste products.
WHAT CAUSES GLUTEN INTOLERANCE?
What causes gluten intolerance?
In some individuals, gluten can cross the epithelial barrier of the small intestine and activate the immune system. This can lead to symptoms in two ways:
Triggering an allergic reaction
Initiating an autoimmune reaction by remaining in the small intestine


This causes significant changes in the gastrointestinal tract and causes intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms mentioned in the ‘Symptoms’ section. Most of the symptoms are developed due to damage in the lining of the small intestine by the antibodies developed as an immune reaction.
TYPES OF GLUTEN INTOLERANCE
Types Of Gluten Intolerance

1. CELIAC DISEASE
1. Celiac disease
Genetic, autoimmune disease in which ingested gluten damages the small intestine
Can run in families
If left untreated, it can lead to other health problems such as thyroid disorders, low bone density and even intestinal cancer.
2. WHEAT ALLERGY
2. Wheat allergy
Refers to immediate allergic reaction after consumption of wheat
Mostly presents with symptoms such as itching, hives, and swelling lips or tongue
3. NON-CELIAC GLUTEN/WHEAT SENSITIVITY (NCGS/NCWS)
3. Non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCGS/NCWS)
Used to describe a diagnosis for individuals who do not have celiac disease or wheat allergy.
Individuals with NCGS do not possess the same antibodies and intestinal damage seen in celiac disease.

Have you heard about FODMAPs?
FODMAPs stands for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, which are short-chain carbohydrates that are resistant to digestion. FODMAPs are commonly found in food items like pasta, bread, onion, garlic, legumes, pulses, milk, apples, honey, processed meats, certain sweeteners etc. FODMAPs have been found to be associated with NCGS.

Note:Everyone with celiac disease is intolerant to gluten but not everyone with gluten sensitivity will develop celiac disease.
SYMPTOMS OF GLUTEN INTOLERANCE
Symptoms Of Gluten Intolerance

People with gluten intolerance usually experience symptoms within 1 hour of consuming gluten. Some people face a delayed gluten reaction which may even take 12 hours to develop symptoms. The common symptoms include:
I. INTESTINAL SYMPTOMS
I. Intestinal symptoms
Abdominal pain (most commonly observed symptom)
Diarrhea
Nausea
Bloating
II. GENERAL BODILY SYMPTOMS
II. General bodily symptoms
Headache
Joint pain
Muscle contractions
Numbness, especially in the hands and feet
Tiredness
III. BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS
III. Behavioral symptoms

Depression
Anxiety

IV. SKIN-RELATED SYMPTOMS
IV. Skin-related symptoms
Redness of the skin
Dry and itchy patches on the skinQuick byte!

RISK FACTORS FOR GLUTEN INTOLERANCE
Risk Factors For Gluten Intolerance

Anybody can have gluten intolerance but there are some factors that increases its risk:
1. FAMILY HISTORY
1. Family history
Individuals with a positive family history of celiac disease or lactose intolerance are more prone to develop gluten intolerance.
2. GENETIC CONDITIONS
2. Genetic conditions
Certain genetic conditions such asDown syndrome, William syndrome or Turner syndrome makes the person more sensitive to gluten containing food.
3. COLITIS
3. Colitis
Colitis i.s.inflammation of the colon (large intestine) also increases the risk of developing gluten intolerance.
4.DIABETES
4.Diabetes
Type 1 diabetes increases the risk of celiac disease in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the body’s own cells.

DIAGNOSIS OF GLUTEN INTOLERANCE
Diagnosis Of Gluten Intolerance

1. RULING OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF OTHER DIGESTIVE CONDITIONS

1. Ruling out the possibility of other digestive conditions
Celiac disease, wheat allergy, and gluten intolerance have similar symptoms upon ingestion of gluten. Firstly, the individuals are kept on a gluten-free diet for some weeks to examine the symptoms. The possibility of other diseases is ruled out if the symptoms start resolving with the removal of gluten from the diet.


2. DIAGNOSING CELIAC DISEASE
2. Diagnosing celiac disease
The diagnosis of celiac disease is usually made through the identification of several antibodies in the blood. Some such antibodies include:
Tissue transglutaminase antibody - IgA
Tissue transglutaminase antibody - IgG
Gliadin antibody IgG
Endomysial antibody IgG
Endomysial antibody IgA
Endomysial antibody IgM
In some cases, a biopsy (tissue examination under the microscope) is needed for confirmation.


Did you know?
Deficiency of immunoglobulin A (IgA) (antibody that acts as the first line of defense) can make the individual prone to celiac disease. Want to detect your IgA levels?

3. DIAGNOSING WHEAT ALLERGY

3. Diagnosing wheat allergy
Wheat allergy markerblood test:IgE is a type of antibody that is usually elevated in allergy. In this, the level of total IgE level is determined.
Skin test:In this skin test, the doctor scratches the skin with the needle containing wheat. The skin reactions are examined to detect allergies.

4. DIAGNOSING NON-CELIAC GLUTEN (NCGS)
4. Diagnosing Non-celiac gluten (NCGS)
Firstly, individuals are given a diet containing gluten for a few weeks.
It is followed by giving placebo.
There is a washout period in between in which placebo and gluten are not given.
Symptoms are traced in both cases which helps in establishing the correlation between gluten and symptoms.

In some cases, intestinal tissue examination under the microscope is required for confirmation.
PREVENTION OF GLUTEN INTOLERANCE
Prevention Of Gluten Intolerance

Gluten intolerance cannot be entirely prevented. However, the episodes of allergic reactions can be prevented by adopting the following lifestyle changes:

1. GO GLUTEN FREE
1. Go Gluten free
Gluten is naturally present in wheat, rye, and barely. Foods made from wheat have the highest amounts of gluten. If you have a gluten allergy, avoid consuming the following food items:
Flour
Bread
Crackers
Baking mixes
Pasta
Cereal
Sauce
Processed meat
Beer
Malt vinegar
2. IDENTIFY THE TRIGGER
2. Identify the trigger
The quantity of gluten varies in different products. It is not necessary that all gluten containing food items triggers an allergic reaction.
The trigger can be identified by eliminating all food, beverages, medication, and cosmetics that have gluten in them. It is followed by adding items one by one. The trigger is then identified based on the appearance of symptoms.


3. BE MORE CONSCIOUS WHILE DINING OUT
3. Be more conscious while dining out
Most of the people may feel the symptoms while dining out. It is advisable to ask for gluten free options which can be safely consumed.


4. CHECK THE HIDDEN GLUTEN CONTENT
4. Check the hidden gluten content
Some food items contain gluten which people are not aware about. These include emulsifiers, dextrin, mono- and di-glycerides, seasonings, and caramel colors.


Sometimes, food can be contaminated with gluten in the process of preparation and packaging. These can be identified through warning labels. Here are some foods and beverages that may contain gluten:


Brown rice syrup
Candies
Wafers
Cold cuts
Hot dogs
Sausage
French fries
Readymade gravies
Fish
Rice mixes
Sauces (soy sauce and vegetable sauce)Did you know?
