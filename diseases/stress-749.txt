STRESS
StressAlso known as Pressure, Tension, and Strain
OVERVIEW
Overview
Stress is the body’s natural response to danger or challenge. While stress itself is a normal part of life, recurring stress can interfere with daily activities and overall well-being. Stress can manifest itself in different ways, including excessive worrying, inability to sleep at night, and body aches.



Triggers generally cause stress, and everyone has different stress triggers. Work stress tops the list, according to surveys. Some of the main sources of stress, apart from work, include finances, relationships, parenting, and day-to-day inconveniences.




Long-term stress can affect the whole body and can cause other serious issues, for example,anxiety,depression, and cardiac problems. If you feel stress is starting to interfere with your daily activities, it’s time to reach out for help. The treatment of stress mainly comprises managing the condition, knowing the triggers, and starting therapies along with lifestyle modifications.

TYPES OF STRESS
Types Of Stress

Stress can show up in different ways, each affecting your body and mind differently. Some common types of stress include:

Acute stress:Short-lived response usually for minutes to hours to an immediate challenge or threat. It fully resolves once the stressor is removed.

Episodic acute stress:Frequent episodes of acute stress in individuals who live under continual time pressure, crises, or chaotic conditions. Symptoms are recurrent and don't fully resolve between events.

Chronic stress:Persistent stress that endures for weeks, months, or years, stemming from ongoing adversities like caregiving, financial strain, or chronic illness.

Traumatic stress:A severe stress response triggered by life-threatening events. Though the event is short, its psychological effects (e.g., PTSD) can be long-lasting.

Eustress:Also known as positive stress. It is motivating stress associated with positive events like starting a new job, planning a wedding.

DIAGNOSIS OF STRESS
Diagnosis Of Stress

There is no specific laboratory test to diagnose stress directly. Diagnosis typically involves a detailed assessment of your personal and family history, symptom patterns, and psychosocial context. Blood and urine tests may be used to rule out underlying medical conditions that can mimic or exacerbate stress-related symptoms.


A structured, face-to-face clinical interview remains the most effective method to evaluate the psychological and physiological impact of stress. However, standardized diagnostic tools and biomarkers for stress are still being researched and are not yet routinely used in clinical practice.

Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT):Focuses on accepting stressful experiences and committing to actions aligned with personal values, especially effective for chronic stress and emotional avoidance.

Positive psychology therapy:Emphasizes building on individual strengths and positive emotions like gratitude and resilience to enhance psychological well-being.

Behavioral therapy:Focuses on modifying maladaptive behaviors that contribute to stress, like avoidance, poor sleep habits, etc. It is often combined with CBT or used in structured environments.

Exposure therapy:Gradually exposes individuals to stress-inducing situations in a controlled setting to desensitize fear and reduce avoidance. Effective in stress-related anxiety and Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Group therapy:Involves shared therapeutic sessions with others facing similar stressors like the loss of a loved one, trauma, or life transitions, providing social support and reducing isolation.



MEDICATIONS

COMPLICATIONS OF STRESS
Complications Of Stress

If stress becomes chronic, it can lead to various mental and physical health issues. The complications of stress include:

Anxiety:It is the brain's way of reacting to stress and alerting the person of potential danger ahead.

Depression:It is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest and can interfere with daily activities.



Insomnia:It is a common sleep disorder that can make it hard to fall asleep and hard to stay asleep.

Phobias:A phobia is an anxiety disorder defined by a persistent and excessive fear of an object or situation.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD):It is a mental health condition that's triggered by a terrifying event, either experiencing it or witnessing it.

Burnout syndrome:Burnout isn't just too much stress—it's a state of complete physical, mental, and emotional exhaustion caused by long-term, unmanaged work stress.

Chronic fatigue syndrome:Also called myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), is characterized by feelings of extreme fatigue, depression, and a general disappointment with life, which can last for several months or years.



Heart disease:Stress may lead to high blood pressure, which can pose a risk for heart attack andstroke.
Erectile dysfunction:It is defined as difficulty getting and keeping an erection. Stress and anxiety can interrupt how your brain sends messages to the penis to allow extra blood flow, leading to this condition.


ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR STRESS
Alternative Therapies For Stress

Alternative therapies for stress are often used as complementary approaches alongside conventional care. These methods should not replace evidence-based medical or psychological treatments for chronic or severe stress. Some of the ways to manage stress include:

MIND-BASED INTERVENTIONS
Mind-based interventions

Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a therapeutic technique in which an instructor guides participants in weekly activities like meditation and yoga in order to reduce stress levels. This technique generally uses yoga and meditation that can help those with anxiety, depression, chronic pain, addiction, immune disorders, high blood pressure, and more.

ACUPUNCTURE
Acupuncture

It relieves stress by promoting the movement of Qi in the body, according to Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). According to TCM, the energy that usually flows smoothly throughout the body can become stuck or scattered due to stress or disease. This can lead to muscle tension, and acupuncture can help with that.

AROMATHERAPY
Aromatherapy

This can reduce the perception of stress, decrease levels of cortisol (stress hormone), and increase contentment. Lavender aromatherapy has shown promising results in promoting sleep in infants and adults. Different aromatherapy scents bring different effects on people.

MASSAGE
Massage

It releases feel-good hormones and relieves stress by lowering the heart rate and increasing relaxation. Receiving a massage is beneficial for increasing the feeling of contentment and well-being, as emotions such as anxiety and depression can be reduced once stress levels are decreased.

TAI CHI
Tai Chi

The researchers found that tai chi provided the same benefits for managing stress-related anxiety as exercise, as it includes meditation and focused breathing. Some researchers also noted that tai chi may be superior to other forms of exercise for reducing stress and anxiety.


VIRTUAL REALITY
Virtual reality

Researchers have taken the first steps toward developing a VR application for stress management, specifically an underwater virtual world that can be used for paced breathing techniques. Also, viewing computer-mediated forms of nature through slideshows of images or videos affects physio-psychological processes, reducing stress levels. The VR effects that have the results include:Resting in the forestDifferent types of forestA water landscapeNatural environment containing some facilities.
