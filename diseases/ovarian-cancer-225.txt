OVARIAN CANCER
Ovarian cancerAlso known as Cancer of the ovary and Ovarian carcinoma
OVERVIEW
Overview
Ovarian cancer is a condition in which there is an uncontrolled growth and multiplication of cells in the ovary.  Ovaries are the primary reproductive glands in females that produce eggs.  They also produce hormones that control the menstrual cycle and pregnancy.

Abnormal vaginal discharge, pelvic pain, bloating, and constipation are common Stage III and IV symptoms of ovarian cancer. Some factors that could put various individuals at risk for this condition include age, family history, BRCA mutations, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and being childless.

Treatment and prognosis for ovarian cancer depend on the location of the tumor, its size, stage, spread, and overall health of the individual. Treatment usually combines debulking surgery with chemotherapy radiation, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, or even combinations of the above. Unfortunately, the prognosis is not so good in cases of ovarian cancer as they often present with late symptoms.

TYPES OF OVARIAN CANCER
Types Of Ovarian Cancer

Ovarian cancer has four types based on the cells from which it arises:
1. EPITHELIAL CELL CARCINOMAS
1. Epithelial cell carcinomas
Epithelial ovarian cancers, making up 85-90% of cases, originate from the ovary's surface, often spreading to the pelvis, abdomen, and beyond. Types of epithelial ovarian cancer include:

High-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOC):These types of cancer spread at a faster rate and usually remain undiagnosed in the initial stages.
Endometrioid carcinoma:This type of cancer spreads to the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus)
Low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (LGSOC):LGSOC spreads slowly and usually affects people at a younger age (between 45 and 57).
Mucinous carcinoma:In this, tumor (mass of cells) is made up of cells coated in mucus.
Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC):This cancer is characterized by the presence of a pelvic mass which causes symptoms such as abdominal pain and bloating.
Primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the ovary:They typically develop from noncancerous) conditions and respond well to treatment.
2. GERM CELL OVARIAN CARCINOMA
2. Germ cell ovarian carcinoma
This type of cancer originates from the reproductive cells of the ovaries.
This cancer is rarely observed and usually affects teenagers.
3. STROMAL CELL OVARIAN CANCER
3. Stromal cell ovarian cancer
These cancers arise from connective tissue cells of the ovaries.
This type of cancer is often found in the early stages.
Vaginal bleeding is one of the most common symptoms of stromal cancer.
4. SMALL CELL CARCINOMA
4. Small cell carcinoma
It is an extremely rare ovarian cancer whose exact origin is still not known.
It usually presents in younger females with features ofhypercalcemia.
CAUSES OF OVARIAN CANCER
Causes Of Ovarian Cancer

Before knowing about the exact cause of ovarian cancer, it is important to understand the structure and function of ovaries.
WHAT ARE OVARIES?
What are ovaries?
Ovaries are the primary reproductive glands in females that produce eggs. Women have two ovaries located on each side of their uterus. The egg produced by the ovaries travels through the fallopian tube and fuses with the sperm. This fertilized egg travels further and settles in the uterus. The uterus nourishes the developing fetus prior to birth.

The ovaries also produce estrogen and progesterone – the two main reproductive hormones of the women.

The exact cause of ovarian cancer is not known. However, there are certain theories behind this which include:
Incessant ovulation theory:The surface epithelial cells of the ovary experience physical injury during ovulation (the process in which a mature egg is released from the ovary). The repetitive trauma to the epithelium can sometimes cause cellular DNA damage. This can turn normal cells into cancerous cells.
Fallopian tube theory:Some ovarian cancers originate from the epithelium of the fallopian tube, which then spills over the surface of the ovary.

The path through cancer can truly be challenging.At Tata 1mg, our patient-centric cancer management platform intends to provide much-needed support and access to affordable care at every stage of the illness.

RISK FACTORS FOR OVARIAN CANCER
Risk Factors For Ovarian Cancer

Various risk factors are associated with an increased chance of ovarian cancer:
1. GENETIC PREDISPOSITION
1. Genetic predisposition
Mutations (changes) in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes significantly increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer.


Get tested for BRCA1 and BRCA2 Gene Sequencing test
Book Test
2. AGE
2. AgeIt is seen that the risk increases steeply from around 45 years.


3. RACE
3. RaceCertain ethnic groups, including Eastern European, Ashkenazi Jewish, North American, and Northern European populations, have a higher risk of ovarian cancer due to the prevalence of BRCA1 mutations.


4. FAMILY HISTORY
4. Family historyA positive family history of breast, ovarian, and fallopian tube cancer increases the risk of ovarian cancer.


5. HISTORY OF CANCER
5. History of cancerIndividuals having a history ofbreast cancer, uterine cancer, andcolorectal cancerhave higher chances of contracting ovarian cancer too.


6. REPRODUCTIVE AND HORMONAL FACTORS
6. Reproductive and hormonal factors
Early menarche (menstruation before age 12)
Latemenopause(menopause after age 50)
Endometriosis(where uterine tissue grows outside the uterus)
Nulliparity (women who have never given birth) are more susceptible to ovarian cancer.


7. HORMONAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY (HRT)
7. Hormonal replacement therapy (HRT)
Prolonged HRT use, especially estrogen beyond 10 years, can particularly raise the risk of ovarian cancer for postmenopausal women.


8. MEDICAL AND GENETIC CONDITIONS
8. Medical and genetic conditions
Diabetes
Lynch syndrome

DIAGNOSIS OF OVARIAN CANCER
Diagnosis Of Ovarian Cancer

The tests that help detect ovarian cancer are:
1. RECTOVAGINAL PELVIC EXAM
1. Rectovaginal pelvic exam
A rectovaginal exam examines and identifies abnormalities in the pelvic area, including the cervix, uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, anus, and rectum.
2. TVUS (TRANSVAGINAL ULTRASOUND)
2. TVUS (transvaginal ultrasound)
In this, an ultrasound wand is put into the vagina to examine the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries.
It helps in the identification of any mass but cannot confirm its cancerous nature.
3. BLOOD TESTS
3. Blood testsCA-125: This test measures the amount of a protein called CA-125 which is known to be elevated in ovarian cancerHuman epididymis protein 4 (HE4): The level of HE4 in the blood is a more sensitive marker to predict ovarian cancer.
4. LAPAROSCOPY
4. LaparoscopyIn this, the ovaries are examined through a thin tube inserted through a small cut in the abdomen.
5. BIOPSY
5. Biopsy
A biopsy is an examination of tissues or fluids under a microscope that helps confirm the diagnosis of ovarian cancer.
It helps to identify the type of illness and the stage of disease, and to choose the most suitable treatment.
6. CT SCAN
6. CT scan
This imaging test uses X-rays to generate a detailed picture of the internal organs to detect the spread of cancer.

A famous Indian actress was diagnosed with Stage IV ovarian cancer in 2012. After a long treatment, she was declared cancer-free in 2015. She shared on her Instagram “During my battle with ovarian cancer in 2012 my doctors gave me my second chance at life.
PREVENTION OF OVARIAN CANCER
Prevention Of Ovarian Cancer

Some factors may help to decrease the risk of ovarian cancer, even though complete prevention against it is not possible. Some of them include:

1. PREGNANCY
1. Pregnancy
Full-term births can greatly reduce the risk of ovarian cancer.

2. CONTRACEPTIVE PILLS
2. Contraceptive Pills
The use of oral methods for at least three years reduces ovarian cancer risk, and the effect may persist for as long as three decades.

3. BREASTFEEDING
3. Breastfeeding
Breastfeeding for one year or longer significantly diminishes the risk of ovarian cancer; the duration during which breast milk is provided also seems to add further risks.

Here are 7 things you must be aware of about breastfeeding.Know Now
4. SURGICAL PROCEDURES

4. Surgical procedures
Women who have had a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) may have a lower risk of developing ovarian/fallopian tube cancer.
Tubal ligation (tying of fallopian tubes) to avoid pregnancy also decreases the risk of ovarian cancer.

TREATMENT OF OVARIAN CANCER
Treatment Of Ovarian Cancer

The treatment of ovarian cancer depend upon the stage of cancer. It includes:
1. DEBULKING SURGERY
1. Debulking surgery
The major aim of debulking surgery is to remove the tumor.
The unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of one ovary along with the fallopian tube) is usually done in the early stage of ovarian cancer.
The hysterectomy/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or BSO (removal of both ovaries and fallopian tubes along with the uterus)  in advanced-stage ovarian cancer may be required.
Sometimes, the spleen, gallbladder, a part of the stomach, liver, pancreas, and part of the colon are also removed depending upon the spread of cancer.
2. RADIATION THERAPY
2. Radiation therapy
It uses high-energy X-rays to kill cancer cells.
The procedure is painless and each session takes a few minutes.
3. CHEMOTHERAPY
3. Chemotherapy
It involves the use of medications to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy is mostly useful to kill small-sized tumors that have left even after surgery. In most cases, a combination of drugs is used as it seems to work better for ovarian cancer. The drugs used during chemotherapy are:PaclitaxelAltretamineCapecitabineCyclophosphamideEtoposideGemcitabineIfosfamideIrinotecanMelphalanPemetrexedTopotecanVinorelbine
4. HORMONAL THERAPY
4. Hormonal therapy
It involves the use of hormones to treat cancer. It is mainly used to treat ovarian stromal tumors. The class of drugs used in hormonal therapy are:


Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists:These drugs block the production of hormone estrogen by the ovaries. The common examples aregoserelinandleuprolide.
Tamoxifen:The primary function of tamoxifen is to reduce the level of the female sex hormone, estrogen. This restricts the growth of cancer cells.
Aromatase inhibitors:These drugs block an enzyme known as aromatase which converts other hormones into estrogen. The drugs that belong to this category areletrozole,anastrozole, andexemestane.
5. TARGETED DRUG THERAPY

5. Targeted drug therapy
Targeted therapy targets specific proteins that help in the growth, division, and spread of cancer cells. The examples include:
Bevacizumab
Olaparib
Rucaparib
6. IMMUNOTHERAPY
6. Immunotherapy
In this, the immune system is modified to destroy cancer cells. This is done through following medications such aspembrolizumab.
