DYSLEXIA
DyslexiaAlso known as Learning disorder
OVERVIEW
Overview

Dyslexia is a learning disorder that affects reading and writing abilities, making it difficult to recognize and process letters and words. It's not related to intelligence but involves challenges with language skills.

The condition varies in severity and can manifest in different ways. Common symptoms include slow and inaccurate reading, difficulty with spelling, and challenges in language-related tasks. Risk factors for dyslexia include a family history of learning difficulties and early language delays. Prenatal exposure to nicotine, alcohol, or drugs can also increase the risk.

Early identification and intervention are crucial for effective support. Educational strategies, specialized interventions, and assistive technologies can help individuals with dyslexia overcome challenges and improve their reading and writing skills.

SYMPTOMS OF DYSLEXIA
Symptoms Of Dyslexia

Dyslexia is characterized by difficulties in decoding and recognizing written words accurately. People with dyslexia may encounter challenges connecting sounds to letters (phonological processing) or recognizing words by sight (visual processing).

TYPES OF DYSLEXIA
Types of Dyslexia

Different types of dyslexia affect different aspects of reading and language processing. They include:

1. Phonological dyslexia:Difficulty recognizing and manipulating spoken language sounds.

2. Surface dyslexia:Difficulty recognizing whole words by sight, leading to challenges in reading irregularly spelled words.

3. Visual dyslexia:Difficulty processing visual information, such as letters and words, which can result in problems with reading and writing.

4. Rapid naming deficit:Difficulty quickly retrieving and naming familiar symbols, letters, or numbers, affecting fluency in reading.

5. Double deficit dyslexia:Combination of phonological processing difficulties and rapid naming deficits, leading to challenges in both decoding and fluency.

CAUSES OF DYSLEXIA
Causes Of Dyslexia

Dyslexia often runs in families. Also, a child’s reading ability is influenced by home literacy and the quality of teaching.
Studies have shown that reading difficulties are highly heritable, with certain genes affecting brain development and reading skills.
Research indicates that individuals with dyslexia have structural and functional differences in their brain related to language processing.
These brain differences are distinct from those found in conditions like autism and ADHD, highlighting the unique pathways leading to dyslexia.
The exact causes of dyslexia are not fully understood, but, certain risk factors can lead to dyslexia, which are discussed below in the next segment.

RISK FACTORS FOR DYSLEXIA
Risk Factors For Dyslexia

Here are some common risk factors associated with dyslexia:
1. GENETIC FACTORS
1. Genetic factors
Dyslexia tends to run in families, suggesting a genetic component.
Certain genes related to language and reading skills may play a role.


2. PRENATAL AND PERINATAL FACTORS
2. Prenatal and Perinatal Factors
Maternal smoking
Alcohol
Drug use during pregnancy
Low birth weight
Premature birth


3. ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
3. Environmental factors
Limited access to books, reading materials, etc
Reduced opportunities for language stimulation


4. FAMILY HISTORY OF READING DIFFICULTIES
4. Family history of reading difficulties
Individuals with a family history of reading difficulties or other learning disabilities may have a higher risk of developing dyslexia.


5. EARLY LANGUAGE DIFFICULTIES
5. Early language difficulties
Children who experience delays in early language development, including difficulties with phonological awareness (the ability to recognize and manipulate the sounds of language), may be at a higher risk for dyslexia.Did you know?
It's a common misconception that dyslexia is indicative of lower intelligence. In reality, individuals with dyslexia often have intelligence levels equal to or even higher than their peers.

DIAGNOSIS OF DYSLEXIA
Diagnosis Of Dyslexia

Diagnosing dyslexia involves a comprehensive assessment and the key steps involved in diagnosis include:

I. SCREENING FOR RISKS
I. Screening for risks
These screenings often involve assessing basic reading skills and phonological awareness.
Screening tools may include standardized tests, teacher observations, and informal assessments.

II. COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION
II. Comprehensive evaluation
A comprehensive evaluation is typically recommended if screening results suggest a potential issue.
This in-depth process delves into various facets of reading, spelling, writing, and language skills.
III. TESTING COMPONENTS

III. Testing Components
The comprehensive evaluation includes a range of tests:

1. Questionnaires:The service provider might ask your child, their carers, or their teachers to complete surveys. Tests to measure reading and language skills may be given to your child.


2. Tests for the brain (neurological), vision, and hearing:These can assist in figuring out whether another disorder is contributing to or causing your child's reading difficulties.


3. Psychological assessment:This can assist in identifying whether your child's abilities may be being hampered by social issues,anxiety, or despair.


4. Tests for academic skills:
Decoding:Assessing the ability to read unfamiliar words by sounding them out.
Oral language skills:Evaluating the individual's spoken language abilities, including vocabulary, grammar, and expressive/receptive language skills.
Reading fluency and comprehension:Testing the speed and understanding of reading passages.
Spelling:Assessing spelling proficiency.
Vocabulary:Evaluating the individual's understanding and use of words.
Word recognition:Examining the ability to recognize and identify words.

Note:Dyslexia is not diagnosed through standardized tests or medical exams, but, through classroom observations and multiple assessments.
