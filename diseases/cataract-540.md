CATARACT
Cataract
OVERVIEW
Overview

A cataract is an eye ailment in which the clear eye lens becomes opaque, obstructing light from passing through and causing a decrease in vision. For people with cataracts, gazing through foggy lenses is comparable to looking through a frosty or fogged-up window.

The majority of cases affect older people, while occasionally, younger people might also be affected. Various factors can cause cataracts, such as smoking, ultraviolet radiation, certain diseases like diabetes, trauma, radiation therapy etc. Cataracts can seriously impede daily activities; if untreated, they might even result in blindness.

Based on the severity of the medical condition, the doctor might ask you for prescription glasses or surgery if required. While prescription glasses cannot directly treat cataracts, they can aid in correcting blurry vision and other problems caused by cataracts.

Surgery is performed when the visual loss due to a cataract severely impacts the patient's quality of life. Cataract surgery is usually safe and effective, significantly improving vision.

CAUSES OF CATARACT
Causes Of Cataract


A cataract is a lens abnormality characterized by decreased transparency and increased cloudiness. The eye's lens is usually clear and made of mostly water and protein.

Crystallins are the main proteins that make the lens and the lens surfaces. They are responsible for the lens's refractive function. These proteins are arranged in a particular fashion that keeps the lens clear and allows light to pass through it. This helps the lens to focus a clear image onto the back of the eye or retinal surface.

Changes in the arrangement and alterations in the character of the lens proteins result first in increasing rigidity of the lens and eventually causing cataract.
TYPES OF CATARACT
Types of Cataract

Cataracts are classified based on the location and how they develop in the eye.

There are four major types of cataracts mainly:


AGE-RELATED CATARACT
Age-related cataract
It is the most common form of cataract. It usually develops in individuals > 50 years of age. Ageing can cause natural changes in the lens of your eye.

SECONDARY CATARACT
Secondary cataract
These cataracts are associated with diseases like diabetes or an eye problem (like glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye), eye infection, etc.). In some cases, medications such as steroids can cause this cataract.

CHILDHOOD CATARACT
Childhood cataract
Although cataracts are rare in children, your child may be at greater risk if you have a family history of childhood cataracts. It can affect one or both eyes (bilateral). In some cases, these cataracts are small and don't cause any trouble with vision.
RISK FACTORS FOR CATARACT
Risk Factors For Cataract


There are several risk factors for cataract development that can be classified as:
AGE
Age
Age-related (or senile) cataract is defined as a cataract occurring in people >50 years of age. It becomes progressively more severe and frequent in the elderly and is responsible for 48% of world blindness.
GENDER
Gender
Women are at a higher risk for most cataracts than men, probably due to a lack of estrogen (reproductive hormone) in post menopausal years.


RACIAL OR ETHNIC GROUPS
Racial or ethnic groups
In comparison to Europeans, white people and persons with Asian ancestry have higher prevalence rates.


GENETICS
Genetics
Genes play an important role in the development of cataract. If your parents had cataract then there is a chance that you might also get cataract.


TRAUMATIC INJURY
Traumatic injury
Damage to your lens because of serious injury to the eye can lead to cataract. This cataract can form quickly after the injury or take many years.
CERTAIN MEDICATIONS

Certain Medications
Studiessuggest that long term use of  corticosteroids can lead to cataracts.
SMOKING

Smoking
The ill effects of smoking on the lungs are known to all. It is a known major risk factor for cataract as well.


ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION
Alcohol consumption
Alcohol increases the risk of cataracts as the lens is sensitive to the direct toxic effects of alcohol.

RADIATION
Radiation
Certain types of radiation, like ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun and radiation therapy for cancer, may predispose to cataract.

SYSTEMIC DISEASES
Systemic diseases
Disorders that increase the risk of the development of cataract include:

Diabetes: Poor control of diabetes mellitus (DM) is linked to several eye complications, including cataracts.

Hypocalcemia:Decreased amount of calcium in the blood can cause eye changes, leading to cataracts.

Hypothyroidism: It refers to a decrease in thyroid hormone production. Though very rare, evidence suggests that hypothyroidism can cause cataracts.
SEVERE DEHYDRATION AND DIARRHEA

Severe dehydration and diarrhea
Severe dehydration, especially at a young age, can lead to cataract. The risk also increases with serious episodes of diarrhea.

DIAGNOSIS OF CATARACT
Diagnosis Of Cataract


Cataracts are visible during clinical evaluation of the eye. The following steps are used evaluate cataracts:
1. HISTORY TAKING
1. History taking

Your healthcare provider will ask about your health history, which comprises the following:
Your chief complaint, i.e. a decrease in vision, any family history of cataract a
Past eye history
Any systemic disease causing or aggravating the symptoms
Your current medications


2. COMPREHENSIVE EYE EXAMINATION
2. Comprehensive eye examination
The comprehensive eye exam will include dilation(eye drops will widen your pupils) to examine the eye.
Tests include:
Visual acuity test: This is the eye chart test. It checks for the ability to see from different distances.
Refraction test:This test assesses the sharpness and clarity of vision. Both eyes are tested individually for their ability to see letters of varying sizes.
Cover test: This test is used to determine if you have a squint as a faulty vision caused by cataract can lead to a squint.
Slit-lamp test:This exam is used to detect issues such as cataracts, eye injuries, and a lens clouding.


3. OTHER EYE INVESTIGATIONS
3. Other eye investigations
Visual acuity test:The test measures how well your distant vision is.
Pupil dilation test:This test is done to purposefully widen the pupils so that the eye doctor can examine the eyes thoroughly.
Tonometry test: This test measures the fluid pressure in the eye.
Contrast sensitivity testing: This test is similar to the visual acuity test and is based on differentiating between shades of grey.
Glare testing:It is based on the fact that vision in different light settings may be altered in cataracts.
Color vision testing: This helps detect acquired color vision defects.
Potential acuity testing: This gives an idea of vision after cataract removal.
Spectacular photographic microscopy: This is done before cataract surgery to see the health of the endothelium.
CELEBS AFFECTED
Celebs affectedAmitabh BachchanAmitabh Bachchan is a renowned Indian actor, who had been suffering from cataract.
He tweeted "Saviour Dr Himanshu Mehta and his dexterity with the very latest medical machinery to remove cataracts despite the age-related soft tissues of mine.

TREATMENT OF CATARACT
Treatment Of Cataract

The choice of treatment depends on the level of opacity that makes it difficult to do basic everyday tasks. These are the options available:
PRESCRIPTION GLASSES
Prescription glasses
Prescription glasses along with sun shades to reduce the sensitivity to light, and magnifying lenses can help the vision to some extent.
While prescription glasses cannot directly treat cataracts, they can aid in correcting blurry vision and other problems caused by cataracts.

SURGERY
Surgery
Surgery is almost always required if visual acuity is less or if there is a medical reason like glaucoma or retinal detachment that negatively affects the eye's health.
Cataract surgery is a permanent solution that successfully enables the patient to see again normally. It involves the removal of the affected lens, which is replaced with an artificial lens.

Note: Many health conditions require optimisation before surgery for better results, such as diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), etc.

COMPLICATIONS OF CATARACT
Complications Of Cataract

Cataract cause multiple complications discussed as follows:
DISEASE-RELATED COMPLICATIONS
Disease-related complications

Corneal ulceration: It is an open sore on your cornea (the transparent part of the eye that allows light to enter the inside)

Corneal perforations: It is a potentially devastating complication that can lead to corneal melting

Iritis:It is swelling and irritation in the colored ring around your eye's pupil

Subluxation of the lens: The lens is considered subluxed when it is partially displaced but remains within the lens space

Secondary glaucoma: Any form of glaucoma in which there is an identifiable cause of increased eye pressure, resulting in optic nerve damage and vision loss

Blindness:Cataract is the leading cause of blindness, accounting for50%of blindness worldwide.

SURGERY-RELATED COMPLICATIONS
Surgery-related complications

Uveitis: It refers to eye inflammation of the uvea, which is the middle layer of the eye wall, between the retina and the sclera (white of the eye).

Posterior capsular thickening: It occurs when a cloudy layer of scar tissue forms behind the lens implant. It is common within the first 6 months after surgery.

Aphakia: It means not having a lens inside your eye. Absence of lens can make the eye out of focus, and vision blurry. It can be caused by surgery for cataracts.

Glaucoma: Cataract surgery can increase the eye's pressure. This can damage the eye's optic nerve, leading to glaucoma.

Retinal detachment:Retinal detachment is a condition that develops when the retina, a light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye, is yanked away from its normal location.

Hyphema: It is the accumulation of red blood cells (RBC) in the anterior chamber of the eye.

Corneal burn: Also known as eye burn, it can result when certain chemicals used during the procedure come into contact with your eyes.

Opacification: Often referred to as "secondary cataract," it is the most common postoperative complication of cataract.Did you know?Cataract has its share of myths and misconceptions. Time to bust these myths related to cataract!Click Here
ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR CATARACT
Alternative Therapies For Cataract

Non-surgical cataract treatment options can successfully minimise the impact of cataracts and slow their progression. However, they cannot make cataracts go away. These alternative therapies for cataracts may include:

HOMEOPATHY
Homeopathy
This therapy can provide some symptomatic relief. Homeopathy medicines work by diluting the protein accumulation in the lens and, thus, preventing the protein clumping resulting in clouding.

LIVING WITH CATARACT
Living With Cataract

Cataracts tend to develop gradually as you age and aren’t usually painful. They won't usually cause vision loss initially, but you'll probably start to notice clouding in your sight, which can be concerning.

Regular eye tests are the best way to detect any eye health problem, as early symptoms might not be noticeable initially.

Cataracts may impact your day-to-day work, especially if your job involves a lot of screen time.
There are some reasonably small lifestyle changes you can make to help you manage cataracts, such as:

Stronger prescription eyeglasses.
Use brighter lights at home and work.
Wear anti-glare sunglasses.
Use magnifying lenses for reading and other activities that require up-close vision.
Time off for appointments and checkups


Cataracts may also affect your driving ability. You might experience glare or halos around bright lights such as headlights and street lights, making night driving harder. So it would be best if you were more careful when driving.

Cataract surgery successfully restores vision in most people. Corrected vision will positively impact life's social and emotional spheres.
HOME-CARE FOR CATARACT
Home-care For Cataract


The majority of the time, cataract surgery effectively restores vision. To prevent infection, postoperative care is crucial during the healing process.

Here are a few tips for rapid recovery:
Try to stay away from dirt and dusty areas.
Avoid strenuous or heavy activities such as vigorous exercise or heavy lifting for the initial few days post-surgery.
Avoid driving until your doctor examines you and permits you to resume driving.
Take your medications such as antibiotics, anti-inflammatory eye drops or other medications precisely as advised by ophthalmologists.
Use protective eye shields or sunglasses outdoors.
Do not rub your eyes.
Avoid swimming or hot tubs for the initial weeks post-surgery.
Avoid using eye makeup without consulting the ophthalmologist.
