OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER
Obsessive-compulsive disorderAlso known as Neurotic and Psychoneurotic
OVERVIEW
Overview
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition in which a person gets caught in a cycle of obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are unwanted, intrusive thoughts, images, or urges that can lead to distressing feelings. Compulsions are behaviors in response to obsessions to decrease distress.

Symptoms vary from person to person and may include the continuous need to keep everything in the right manner, fear of contamination, repeated body movements, and a constant urge to correct things.

OCD can affect people of all ages and walks of life. Though the exact cause of OCD is unknown, risk factors like childhood trauma, genetic changes, family history, and certain changes in the brain structure are linked to the development of OCD.

Treatment of OCD requires being mindful of one's thoughts and behavior. Cognitive behavioral therapy and medications can help manage the symptoms of OCD.

CAUSES OF OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD)
Causes Of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)

OCD is multifactorial, and an inability to cope with uncertainty, an increased sense of responsibility along with overthinking can predispose those to obsessive-compulsive habits. Though the exact cause of OCD remains unknown, certain risk factors can increase your chances of developing OCD.
RISK FACTORS FOR OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD)
Risk Factors For Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)

There is an array of factors that can lead to obsessive-compulsive disorder. OCD is characterized by obsessive and compulsive thoughts, and the risk factors can include:
1. GENETIC MUTATIONS
1. Genetic mutations
Research shows that there is a genetic predisposition to the development of OCD. Mutations (changes) in certain genes have been linked to OCD.
2. FAMILY HISTORY
2. Family history
Children with parents or siblings who have OCD are at a higher risk for developing OCD themselves. Research has shown the risk is as high as 45% to 65% in children and 27% to 45% in adults.
3. ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
3. Environmental factors
Childhood trauma and obsessive-compulsive symptoms are interlinked. Studies show that the development of OCD symptoms can be due to trauma during childhood, however, more research is needed to understand this relationship better.

4. BRAIN STRUCTURE
4. Brain structure
There is some connection between OCD symptoms and abnormalities in certain areas of the brain, but it is not clear. It is hypothesized that problems in communication between the front part of the brain and deeper structures of the brain are attributed to OCD.
5. STREPTOCOCCAL INFECTIONS
5. Streptococcal infections
Certain studies have shown that earlier onset of OCD is seen after a Streptococcal infection known as PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections).
DIAGNOSIS OF OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD)
Diagnosis Of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)

Diagnosis of any mental health condition can be tricky, it mainly relies on physical examination and psychological evaluation. Steps to help diagnose OCD may include:
1. SCREENING FOR OCD
1. Screening for OCD

A. NICE guidelines:According to studies, the recently launched NICE guideline recommends six screening questions, that include:
Do you wash or clean a lot?Do you check things a lot?Is there any thought that keeps bothering you that you would like to get rid of but can’t?Do your daily activities take a long time to finish?Are you concerned about orderliness or symmetry?Do these problems trouble you?

B. Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS):It is the most widely accepted tool to screen for OCD.The Y-BOCS rates on a scale from 0 to 40 (40 being the most severe of symptomatology). It ranks the individual, based on severity:The time occupied by obsessive thoughts and compulsionsThe interference of obsessive thoughtsThe distress of obsessive thoughtsResistance against obsessionsDegree of control over obsessive thoughtsThe time occupied by compulsive behaviorThe interference of compulsive behaviorThe distress associated with compulsive behaviorResistance against compulsive behaviorDegree of control over compulsive behaviors.
2. PHYSICAL EXAM

2. Physical exam
It is done to help rule out other problems that could be causing the symptoms and to check for any related complications.
3. PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION

3. Psychological evaluation
This includes discussing your thoughts, feelings, symptoms, and behavior patterns. Recognition of obsessive-compulsive disorder may require direct questions. Also, your doctor may use criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association.
4. LAB TESTS

4. Lab tests
These are done to check for co-morbidities and other conditions and may include:Complete blood count (CBC)Thyroid function testScreening for alcoholand drugs

TREATMENT OF OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD)
Treatment Of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)

The treatment for OCD mainly focuses on improving the quality of life and taming the symptoms to manage daily activities. It mainly consists of the following:
COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT)
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
CBT is a type of talk therapy. The most used form of CBT in the management of obsessive-compulsive disorder is exposure and response prevention (ERP). During this, the individuals are exposed to feared situations or images that focus on their obsessions. However, it can evoke anxiety in some cases.
MEDICATIONS
Medications
A class of medications used to treat OCD is known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), typically used to treat depression. Research suggests that SSRIs and SRI likeclomipramineare recommended as first-line agents for drug treatment. The best treatment for severe symptoms of OCD is a combination of CBT and SSRIs. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved SSRIs for the management of OCD include:FluoxetineFluvoxamineParoxetineSertraline

NEUROSURGICAL TREATMENT
Neurosurgical treatment
Surgical procedures like gamma ventral capsulotomy can be very effective for patients who do not respond to typical treatments. Deep brain stimulation, which involves an implanted device in the brain, has data to support its efficacy. However, it is still highly invasive and complex to manage.
NEWER ADVANCEMENTS
Newer advancements
A. Immunological therapies:Immunomodulatory therapy represents a new field, however, more research is required on this front. Some drugs used are:CelecoxibNonspecific nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
B. Pharmacogenetics:It studies how a person's genes respond to medications. Currently, several pharmacogenetic approaches have been conducted on the association between candidate genes with OCD and drug response.
C. Psychotherapy:Recent advances have been made that focus on positive reinforcement, rather than asking the patient to face their fears, as in CBT, they include:Rational emotive therapy:This therapy uses developed danger ideation reduction therapy (DIRT). It focuses on not undergoing exposure for patients with contamination fears.Third-wave therapies:This therapy uses mindfulness in OCD, which teaches individuals to focus on the world around them rather than their internal dialogue.

Poor quality of life:Studies show that the quality of life in OCD patients is significantly impaired compared to that in the general population as OCD hampers an individual’s ability to enjoy life.
Skin problems:Excessive hand washing can make the skin dry and cause dermatitis (inflammation of the skin).

Difficulty in maintaining relationships:Individuals with OCD are possessive and insecure around romantic relationships leading to doubts, and discomfort. They eventually end up hurting the relationship.
Problems with daily activities:Individuals spend way too much time trying to make or do things right, due to their repetitive nature. This makes it difficult for them to concentrate on work or school.
Suicidal tendency:Studies have shown that individuals with OCD have other co-morbid disorders like depression and anxiety, which can lead to suicidal thoughts and behavior.Did you know?Fear of COVID infections can aggravate OCD symptoms. Individuals with OCD are generally germaphobes (fear of germs).

ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD)
Alternative Therapies For Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)

Management of OCD requires continuous efforts. Along with CBT and medications, there are a few alternative therapies that have shown promising results. They include:
1. MINDFULNESS
1. Mindfulness
It involves making a special effort to give your full attention to what is happening in the present moment, to what’s happening in your body, your mind, or your surroundings. Studies show that practicing mindfulness along with CBT and medications can help manage mild to moderate cases of OCD.
2. HYPNOTHERAPY
2. Hypnotherapy
Hypnotherapy is a type of complementary therapy that uses hypnosis, which is an altered state of consciousness. Hypnosis is widely promoted as a treatment for anxiety, however, it may not be the best option for the treatment of OCD.
3. COGNITIVE ANALYTIC THERAPY (CAT)
3. Cognitive analytic therapy (CAT)
CAT focuses on an individual's relationships. It is used in individuals living with depression, anxiety, or eating problems, who tend to self-harm, and with personal or relationship problems. CAT may help someone with OCD, but only to a certain extent.
4. EYE MOVEMENT DESENSITIZATION
4. Eye movement desensitization
This is a newer form of therapy that specifically focuses to help people with difficult traumatic memories. EMDR combines talking to a therapist about traumatic experiences with a technique where you make rapid rhythmic eye movements while recalling traumatic events to help you process them. Individuals with OCD can be considered for this therapy if they do not respond to CBT.
5. INTERPERSONAL THERAPY (IPT)
5. Interpersonal therapy (IPT)
This therapy focuses on relationships with other people and how your thoughts, feelings, and behavior are affected by your relationships. However, there is little evidence that this therapy can work for individuals with OCD.
6. DIALECTICAL BEHAVIOR THERAPY (DBT)
6. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)
This therapy is an extension of CBT, that helps individuals experiencing borderline personality disorder. At this time there is little evidence to suggest it can help treat OCD any more than CBT.
7. EMOTIONAL FREEDOM TECHNIQUE (EFT)
7. Emotional freedom technique (EFT)
This therapy is commonly known as psychological acupressure, which aims to release emotional blockages within the body’s energy system.
