TINNITUS (RINGING IN THE EARS)
Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)Also known as Ringing in the ears, Noises or buzzing in the ears, and Ear buzzing
OVERVIEW
Overview

Commonly known as ringing ears, tinnitus is characterized by sounds such as buzzing, ringing, or hissing in one or both ears without any external source. This phantom noise can be continuous or intermittent.

Individuals with tinnitus may experience hearing loss or difficulty in focusing due to the persistent noise. Common causes of tinnitus include exposure to loud noise, old age, ear infections and stress. In some cases, it can also be a symptom of underlying medical conditions like Meniere's disease, Temporomandibular joint disorders, or heart issues.

Management of tinnitus involves identifying and addressing any underlying causes, managing stress, using hearing aids or sound therapy to improve hearing, and employing relaxation techniques to alleviate the perception of noise.

CAUSES OF TINNITUS
Causes Of Tinnitus

Tinnitus can happen in different parts of the hearing system, from the ear to the brain.

A common reason is damage to tiny hair cells in the ear caused by loud noise or aging. When these cells don't send signals properly, the brain tries to make up for it by increasing the signals it gets, like turning up the volume on a radio.

This is when tinnitus happens, which can be a high or low-pitched sound, depending on the hearing problem.Did you know?Tinnitus can be an early sign of hearing loss in older adults and may result from various ear, medical, and psychological factors.
RISK FACTORS FOR TINNITUS

DIAGNOSIS OF TINNITUS
Diagnosis Of Tinnitus

Here are the steps typically involved in diagnosing tinnitus:
1. MEDICAL HISTORY
1. Medical history
Your doctor will start by taking a detailed medical history, including asking about your symptoms, how long you've experienced tinnitus, any associated conditions or medications, and possible exposure to loud noises.


2. EAR EXAMINATION
2. Ear examination
An ENT specialist may conduct a thorough examination of your ears, including checking for any visible issues, earwax blockage, or signs of infection that could contribute to tinnitus.

3. HEARING TESTS (AUDIOMETRY)
3. Hearing tests (audiometry)
Audiometric tests, such as pure-tone audiometry, can help assess your hearing abilities and identify any hearing loss or other auditory issues that may be related to tinnitus.

Communicate to your doctor the specific tinnitus noises you experience, as they can aid in identifying potential underlying causes:
Clicking:Suggests muscle contractions in or around the ear
Pulsing, rushing, or humming:Often linked to blood vessel issues like high blood pressure, noticeable during exercise, or position changes.
Low-pitched ringing:This may indicate ear canal blockages, Meniere's disease, or stiff inner ear bones (otosclerosis).
High-pitched ringing:Commonly heard and likely related to loud noise exposure, hearing loss, cancer, or certain medications.

4. IMAGING STUDIES
4. Imaging studies
If the diagnosis is not clear from the history and physical examination, imaging studies are done for a precise outcome. Imaging is sometimes needed to rule out structural issues within the ear or brain that could be causing tinnitus. These include:
X-ray:This is used to evaluate the jaws and surrounding areas of the earComputed tomography (CT) scan ormagnetic resonance imaging (MRI):It can be done to visualize the middle and inner ear.

5. TYMPANOMETRY TEST
5. Tympanometry test
Tympanometry is a test assessing middle ear function by measuring the movement of the eardrum in response to pressure changes that can help identify tinnitus-related issues.
