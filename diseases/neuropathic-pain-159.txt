NEUROPATHIC PAIN
Neuropathic painAlso known as Nerve pain and Neuralgia
OVERVIEW
Overview

Neuropathic pain is defined as the shooting or burning pain as a result of nerve damage. The intensity of pain is often severe and impacts the overall quality of life.

Conditions like brain injuries, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, autoimmune disorders, cancer, alcoholism and use of certain medications increase the risk of neuropathic pain.

Medications along with physiotherapy, relaxation and massage therapy, are known to improve the symptoms.

Neuropathic pain can lead to a feeling of hopelessness or anger due its chronic nature. It can interfere with normal activities such as sleep, exercise, and sex. Surrounding oneself with friends and family along with psychological help can make one deal with the emotional aspect of the disease.

SYMPTOMS OF NEUROPATHIC PAIN
Symptoms Of Neuropathic Pain

The symptoms of neuropathic mostly start appearing after a long time of injury. It may take from several months to years. Initially, a person may experience pain in their digits which can be progressed to limbs.

The pain may be mild or severe but often worse at night. The symptoms may persist even beyond the healing period.
Spontaneous pain:It refers to the shooting, burning, stabbing, or electric shock like pain usually in the arms and legs. It feels like someone has pricked the needle on the skin.

Evoked pain (allodynia):It is defined as "pain due to a stimulus that does not normally provoke pain”. Pain is experienced in normal activities such as gentle touch on the skin, buttoning the shirt, touching a cold surface, and brushing their teeth.

Hyperalgesia:It refers to the increased sensitivity to pain. The brain of individuals with hyperalgesia overreacts with normal painful triggers such as pinpricks and heat.

Hypoalgesia:Sometimes, a person may have decreased sensitivity to pain for  normal painful triggers.

Loss of sensations in a part of the body

OTHER SYMPTOMS INCLUDE:
Other symptoms include:
Trouble in sleeping
Emotional problems

TYPES OF NEUROPATHIC PAIN
Types Of Neuropathic Pain

There are several types of neuropathic pain depending on different criteria.

Neuropathic pain can be of two types according to the quantity of nerve involves:
1. MONONEUROPATHY
1. Mononeuropathy
If the neuropathic pain is due to the damage to one nerve, it is termed as mononeuropathy.
The most common example is carpal tunnel syndrome that involves the compression of a single nerve of the wrist.

2. POLYNEUROPATHY
2. Polyneuropathy
The pain that arises due to the damage to two or more nerves is known as polyneuropathy.
The development of neuropathic pain in diabetes is polyneuropathy.


Based on the types of nerves involved, NT can be of following types:

1. PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHIC PAIN
1. Peripheral neuropathic pain
It affects the nerves of the peripheral nervous system (nerves that present outside the brain and spinal cord).
Ex: Diabetic neuropathy. Uncontrolled blood sugar damages the nerves, particularly those in the toes and feet.

2. CENTRAL NEUROPATHIC PAIN
2. Central neuropathic pain
Affects the nerves in the brain, or more specifically, the nerves that branch out from your brainstem.
3. AUTONOMIC NEUROPATHIC PAIN

3. Autonomic neuropathic pain
Affects the nerves that control bodily functions, such as urination, bowel movements, heart rate, and blood pressure.
CAUSES OF NEUROPATHIC PAIN
Causes Of Neuropathic Pain

Before understanding the cause of neuropathic pain, it is important to know the concept of neuron and mechanism of pain.


WHAT ARE NEURONS?
What are neurons?
These are nerve cells that send messages all over the body.
Neurons receive sensory input from the external world and send motor commands to our muscles after processing in the brain.
There are  approximately 86 billion neurons present in the human brain.
There is a huge involvement of neurons in the perception of pain.

MECHANISM OF PAIN
Mechanism of pain
Any painful stimulus such as pressure, pinch, heat, chemical, and burn activates the pain receptors (nociceptive receptors) that are widely distributed in the skin and deep tissues.
These pain receptors send signals to the brainstem (bottom part of brain) via first order neurons
There is a release of calcium in the brainstem which leads to the release of a chemical called glutamate
The released glutamate binds to special receptors present on the second order neurons
These neurons then cross over in the spinal cord and reaches to to the cerebral cortex (part of the brain that is involved in sensation of pain)

Note:An inhibitory pathway is also present in the brain stem which travels down the spinal cord. This pathway has several connecting neurons that release chemicals such as serotonin, noradrenaline, and gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) which avoid the feeling of pain.

Pain cessation results in the dominance of inhibitory pathways whereas pain enhancement is the outcome of stimulatory pathway dispensing upon the painful stimuli.

HOW DOES NEUROPATHIC PAIN ORIGINATE?
How does neuropathic pain originate?
There are multiple theories behind neuropathic pain. Although the exact mechanism is not clear, neuropathic pain may arise due to the:

Increased activity of the first-order neurons if they are partially damaged
Impairment of inhibitory pathway
Development of a memory of pain in the second and third-order neurons due to alterations in the central processing of pain
Increase in the sensitivity of neurons
Reduced the activation threshold of neuronDid you know?Popping a painkiller is one of the most common ways to treat pain at home. However, using these medicines more often than not is not a good idea as it might lead to health complications and side-effects. Here’s more on the types of painkillers, their mechanism and common side-effects (if any) you need to know.Read To Know

DIAGNOSIS OF NEUROPATHIC PAIN
Diagnosis Of Neuropathic Pain

There can be multiple causes of neuropathic pain. So, it is very important to uncover the primary cause of it. The diagnosis involves the understanding of medical history. The doctor may also inquire about:

Exposure to toxins
Medications
Trauma
Nutritional deficiencies
Consumption of alcohol

There are no standard tests to diagnose neuropathy. However, following tests may aid in diagnosis.


1. QUANTITATIVE SENSORY TESTING (QST)
1. Quantitative sensory testing (QST)
In this test, individuals are given some sort of stimuli to induce pain.
The stimuli is given in ascending and descending orders of magnitude.
QST measures the perception of mechanical, thermal, and painful stimuli.
It is useful to assess allodynia and hyperalgesia.
This technique does not diagnose other conditions with the same sensory abnormalities as neuropathic pain.

2. NERVE CONDUCTION STUDY (NCS)
2. Nerve conduction study (NCS)
In this test, two electrodes are placed on the skin. One electrode stimulates the nerve and the other electrode records the time taken by the muscle to contract in response to the electrical pulse.

3. SKIN BIOPSY
3. Skin biopsy
This involves examination of a small sample of skin tissue under a microscope. It helps to detect nerve degeneration or the presence of any lesions  under the skin as a possible cause of neuropathic pain.

4. OTHER TESTS
4. Other tests
Some other tests are also performed to determine the other disorder with similar set of symptoms or to diagnose the exact cause of neuropathic pain. These include:

Complete blood count
Glycosylated hemoglobin (Hba1c)
Vitamin and mineral (copper,  thiamine, pyridoxine,folate,Vitamin B12, andVitamin E)
Metal (mercury, lead, and arsenic)
Infectious disease (Lyme disease, Epstein-Barr virus,HIV, and syphilis)
Antibody testing for specific autoimmune diseases known to cause peripheral neuropathies such as Sjogren syndrome, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.
MRI or CT scans in cases where compression of the nerve is of concern
Nerve biopsy
Genetic testing (for inherited neuropathies)
Urine test

1.The treatment usually focuses on the underlying disease such as-Glucose control in diabetic neuropathyCessation of alcohol in alcoholic neuropathySupplementation in vitamin and mineral deficiencies.
2.Chronic neuropathic pain is usually treated using corticosteroids.

3.Neuropathic pain that develops due to  small-fiber neuropathies, does not typically respond to pain relief medications. Such severe pain requires the use of certain anti-epileptics, and tricyclic antidepressants.

II. PHARMACOLOGICAL (DRUG) THERAPY
II. Pharmacological (drug) therapy
It includes the following class of drugs:

1. Antidepressants:They are effective against steady burning and aching pain. The common examples include:
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs):Amitriptyline,imipramine,nortriptylineanddoxepin
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs):Fluoxetine,paroxetine,sertralineandcitalopram.
Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs):Venlafaxine

2. Anti-epileptic drugs:These drugs act via enhancing the effect of inhibitory chemicals such as GABA. The common examples arecarbamazepineandgabapentin.

3. Opioid analgesics:These drugs act via decreasing pain impulses from the brain. Oxycodone is the most commonly used opioid in relieving neuropathic pain.

4. Local anesthetics:They work by desensitization of the affected part. The 5%lidocainepatch is used for post-herpetic neuralgia.

III. OTHER TREATMENT MODALITIES
III. Other treatment modalities
In case of chronic neuropathic pain that has failed to respond to conservative medical management, the following approaches are considered:Epidural injections (injection into the space around the spinal nerves in your lower back) of local anesthetics and corticosteroids.Implantation of epidural and intrathecal drug delivery systems.Insertion of spinal cord stimulators.Local nerve blocks.

COMPLICATIONS OF NEUROPATHIC PAIN
Complications Of Neuropathic Pain


The chronic ongoing neuropathic pain can lead to serious complications:

1 Injuries:The loss of sensations increases the chances of injuries and wounds due to lack of feeling of pain.

2. Gangrene:Untreated infected wounds can even lead to gangrene – death of a tissue due to reduced blood supply. In rare cases, it can even lead to amputation (removal of a body part) in order to prevent  the infection from spreading.

3. Loss of bladder control:Neuropathy can even cause involuntary urination due to loss of sensation in the bladder. Diabetic neuropathy is the most common cause of this condition, but it is also seen in people with Guillain-Barré syndrome, and HIV infection.

4. Disturbed sleep:The constant pain hampers the quality of sleep in most of the individuals with neuropathic pain.

5. Anxiety and Depression:Many people with neuropathic pain develop mood swings, anxiety and depression due to the chronic nature of the condition.
ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR NEUROPATHIC PAIN
Alternative Therapies For Neuropathic Pain

Many patients with neuropathic pain pursue complementary and alternative treatments that include:
1. ACUPUNCTURE
1. Acupuncture
Acupuncture is the practice of penetrating the skin with thin needles. These needles  are then activated through gentle and specific movements of the practitioner's hands or with electrical stimulation.

The technique might release chemicals that numb pain, or block the pain signals sent from the nerves.

2. PERCUTANEOUS ELECTRICAL NERVE STIMULATION
2. Percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
In this, nerves are stimulated through electrodes placed under the skin. This makes the muscles contract which helps in relieving pain.
There is another technique called transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, in which electrodes are placed on the skin.

3. PHYSICAL THERAPY (PHYSIOTHERAPY)
3. Physical therapy (physiotherapy)
Nerve damage can lead to muscle weakness and wasting. Physiotherapy helps in improving muscle tone, balance and coordination. It includes guided movements, massages and application of stimuli such as heat, cold, and electrical currents.
4. OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY

4. Occupational therapy
This therapy is recommended in individuals who have trouble coordinating normal physical movements such as walking up or down stairs, kicking balls, or jumping.

5. MASSAGE
5. Massage
Massage is helpful in providing symptomatic relief. Massage applied to specific muscles often increases blood flow and releases knots of muscle tension which helps in reducing overall pain.

6. GRADED MOTOR IMAGERY
6. Graded motor imagery
It involves various innovative exercises and movements to target neuropathic pain.

7. COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY
7. Cognitive behavioral therapy
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that helps individuals to cope better with the emotional symptoms of severe neuropathic pain.
LIVING WITH NEUROPATHIC PAIN
Living With Neuropathic Pain


The following measures help in managing the pain:

1. INDULGE IN EXERCISE
1. Indulge in exercise
Individuals with neuropathic pain should indulge in exercise regularly. Stretching and yoga are found to be very effective in increasing the flexibility of muscles and reducing the severity of pain.

2. USE COMPRESSION SOCKS
2. Use compression socks
Individuals with neuropathic pain in the feet should use compression socks. They help to reduce swelling and inflammation and overall pain.
3. TAKE ADEQUATE REST

3. Take adequate rest
People should take regular breaks from normal activities such as walking, standing, and other activities. Adequate rest also helps in repairing the nerves faster.

4. AVOID ALCOHOL
4. Avoid alcohol
Individuals with NP should avoid alcohol as it may hamper recovery. This is because alcohol negatively affects the absorption of several vital vitamins and minerals that are required for the normal functioning of the nerves.

5. MANAGING EMOTIONAL STRESS
5. Managing emotional stress
Living with neuropathic pain can develop a feeling of hopelessness, anger or even depression due to the constant pain.

People may start withdrawing themselves from people and may stop doing the fun things you used to do. The following measures may help in managing the emotional chaos:
Surround yourself with friends, family and people who give you support.
Be open to activities you love and that bring you happiness.
Explore activities that will stimulate you mentally, such as reading or puzzles.
Be open with the people you live with and others close to you.Did our information help you?In our relentless endeavour to keep improving our services, you are our eyes.
