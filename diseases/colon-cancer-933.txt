COLON CANCER
Colon cancerAlso known as Colorectal cancer, Bowel cancer, and CRC
OVERVIEW
Overview
Colon cancer is a condition in which there is an uncontrolled growth and multiplication of cells in the colon (large intestine). The colon is the lower and final part of the digestive tract where the body draws out water and salt from solid waste. The waste then moves through the rectum and exits the body through the anus.

Common risk factors for colorectal cancer include increasing age, a family history of colon cancer, colon polyps, and long-standing ulcerative colitis. Most colon cancers develop from polyps lining the colon. While the polyps are initially non-cancerous and harmless, over time, they can develop into cancer.

Colon polyps and early cancer may have no cancer-specific early signs or symptoms. Therefore, regular colorectal cancer screening is important. Diagnosis of colon cancer is done by colonoscopy, which visualizes the entire colon, along with biopsy confirmation of cancerous tissue.

The treatment and prognosis of colon cancer depend on the location, size, stage, and extent of cancer spread, as well as the overall health of the individual. In the early stages of colon cancer, the tumor is removed through surgery. The treatment in advanced stages involves chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or their combinations.

CAUSES OF COLON CANCER
Causes Of Colon Cancer

Normally, body cells grow, divide, and die in a controlled way. Cancer happens when cells grow uncontrollably and don’t die. The exact cause of this in the colon and rectum is not fully known.

One possible reason is changes in DNA that affect oncogenes (genes that help cells survive). When oncogenes are disturbed, it can increase the risk of colon cancer.

Colorectal cancer often starts as precancerous polyps in the colon or rectum. These polyps can turn into cancer over time.

Certain factors are also associated with an increased risk of colon cancer. The risk factors are described in detail in the next section.
RISK FACTORS FOR COLON CANCER
Risk Factors For Colon Cancer

Various risk factors are associated with an increased chance of colon cancer. These include:

NON-MODIFIABLE FACTORS
Non-modifiable factors

1. Age:The risk of precancerous polyps and colon cancer rises with age, especially after 65, though it can still occur in younger adults.

2. Gender and race:Men are at a higher risk of developing colon cancer than women. Also, non-Hispanic blacks are at higher risk than Asians and non-Hispanic whites.

3. History of cancer:The chances of developing colon cancer are higher if you have a previous history of colon cancer or polyps.

4. Health conditionsInflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)Colon polypsDiabetes mellitus

5. Genetic conditionsNonpolyposis colorectal cancer (NPCC)Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)Gardner syndromeJuvenile polyposis syndromeMuir–Torre syndromeMUTYH-polyposisPeutz-Jeghers syndromeTurcot syndrome

6. Family history:It is estimated that people with first-degree (parents, siblings, and children) relatives diagnosed with colon cancer have a two times higher risk of developing it.

MODIFIABLE OR LIFESTYLE FACTORS
Modifiable or lifestyle factors
Unhealthy dietExcessive alcohol consumptionSedentary lifestyleObesitySmoking

People who smoke have an increased risk of developing colon cancer in comparison to non-smokers. Get rid of this habit with our wide range of smoking cessation products.

OTHER FACTORS
Other factors

1. Gut microbiota:The gut microbiota is made up of helpful microbes that live in our digestive system and support digestion, vitamin production, and immunity. When this balance is disturbed, it can increase the risk of colon cancer.

2. Radiation therapy:Radiation therapy that focuses on the abdomen also increases the chances of colon cancer.

3. Cholecystectomy:It is the removal of the gallbladder, which can lead to continuous bile flow, which may irritate colon cells and increase the risk of colon cancer.Did you know?
Studies suggest that too much sugar may raise the risk of several cancers in both men and women. It’s not just linked to diabetes and obesity. Read this article to understand how.Know More
DIAGNOSIS OF COLON CANCER
Diagnosis Of Colon Cancer

Colon cancer develops gradually in the following stages:
Stage 0 ( cancer in situ):The cancer cells are limited to the inner lining of the colon.Stage I:The cancer cells start attacking the muscular layer of the colon or rectum.Stage II A:Tumor starts growing into the outermost layers of the colon or rectum.Stage II B:The tumor starts growing into the innermost layers of the colon or rectum.Stage II C:The tumor starts spreading to the nearby tissues.Stage III A:The tumor starts growing into the intestine's muscular layers and invading the nearby 1-3 lymph nodes.Stage III B:The tumor starts growing into the bowel wall or to surrounding organs and 1-3 lymph nodes.Stage III C:The cancer has spread to 4 or more lymph nodes.Stage IV A:The cancer has spread to one distant part of the body, such as the lungs or liver.Stage IV B:The cancer has spread to more than one distant part of the body.Stage IV C:The cancer has spread to the lining of the abdominal cavity.

Facing a cancer diagnosis can be overwhelming. Read this guide to understand why getting a second opinion could make all the difference.

The common diagnostic tests include:

1. STOOL-BASED TESTS
1. Stool-based tests

Fecal immunochemical test (FIT):This test detects the hidden blood in the stool, an early sign of colon cancer.

Guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT):This test detects hidden blood in stool using a chemical reaction, helping identify potential early signs of colon cancer.

FIT-DNA test:Also called the stool DNA test, it checks for hidden blood and DNA changes linked to colon cancer or polyps in the stool.

2. COLONOSCOPY
2. Colonoscopy

This test uses a long, thin, and flexible tube with a camera on its end to check for polyps and cancer in the rectum and colon. Abnormal tissues can also be removed during a colonoscopy.

3. FLEXIBLE SIGMOIDOSCOPY
3. Flexible sigmoidoscopy

This test detects polyps and cancer in the rectum and sigmoid colon using a sigmoidoscope. A sigmoidoscope is a short tube with a camera and a tool attached to it. The tool is used to remove polyps and abnormal tissues.

4. CT COLONOGRAPHY (VIRTUAL COLONOSCOPY)
4. CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy)

This test captures images of the entire colon using X-rays. The images are then studied by the doctor using a computer screen. A colonoscopy is usually performed to remove polyps after CT colonography if it confirms the presence of polyps and cancer.

5. BIOPSY
5. Biopsy

In a biopsy, a small amount of tissue is studied under a microscope to confirm the diagnosis. The tissue can be collected either through colonoscopy or surgery. Sometimes, the tissue is taken using a needle biopsy.

6. BIOMARKER TESTING
6. Biomarker testing

This test is used to detect certain genes, proteins, and other factors that are highly specific to the tumor. The test is performed on a tumor sample taken from a biopsy.

7. BLOOD TEST
7. Blood test

Complete blood count:This test indicates the status of red blood cells (RBCs) in the blood. It helps in the detection of anemia.
Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA):A protein that indicates the spread of the tumor to other parts of the body. However, it is not highly specific to cancer.

8. IMAGING TESTS
8. Imaging tests

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):It is used to measure the tumor size and to track the location of colon cancer.
Ultrasound:It is used to find the locations where a tumor has spread.
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan:It helps detect the spread of colon cancer by highlighting areas of abnormal metabolic activity in the body.PET Scan
Chest X-rays:X-rays of the chest are used to detect if colon cancer has spread to the lungs.

TREATMENT OF COLON CANCER
Treatment Of Colon Cancer

There are various treatment options for colon cancer, which are given considering the risk factors, stage of colon cancer, side effects, and age of the individual. These include:

1. SURGERY
1. Surgery

Local excision:In this, the tumor is removed through the tube inserted in the colon with a cutting tool at its end. It is mostly used in the early stages of cancer.

Resection of the colon:In this, a part of the colon is also removed along with the cancer. It is used when the tumor is large.



2. CHEMOTHERAPY
2. Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy involves the use of anticancer drugs to kill cancer cells. The medicines used to treat colon cancer include:
5-Fluorouracil(5FU)Calcium leucovorinOxaliplatinCapecitabineIrinotecanCetuximabPanitumumabRegorafenib

3. RADIATION THERAPY
3. Radiation therapy

External beam radiation therapy (EBRT):In this therapy, intense radiation is given from outside the body using a machine. This technique is used if there is a small number of tumors where surgery is contraindicated.

Internal radiation therapy (Brachytherapy):In this, a radioactive substance is placed in the rectum near the cancer cells. This helps in the specific exposure of the radiation to the targeted site.

4. ABLATION TECHNIQUE
4. Ablation technique

Radiofrequency ablation:In this, the tumor is killed through a needle inserted through the skin. The technique used radio waves to kill the cancer cells.

Microwave ablation: This technique uses electromagnetic waves that create high temperatures in the body. The high temperature kills cancer cells.

Ethanol (alcohol) ablation:It is also known as percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI). In this procedure, concentrated alcohol is injected into the tumor using a needle to kill cancer cells.

Cryoablation (cryosurgery or cryotherapy):This technique uses a probe to freeze and kill cancer cells.

5. TARGETED THERAPY
5. Targeted therapy

a) Monoclonal antibodies:These are specialized proteins that can attach to the cancer cells and inhibit their growth. Examples include:
BevacizumabRamucirumabCetuximabPanitumumab


b) Angiogenesis inhibitors:This class inhibits the formation of new blood vessels that cancer cells require to grow and multiply. Examples include:
Ziv-afliberceptRegorafenib


c) Protein kinase inhibitors:They block the special proteins that are needed for the multiplication of cancer cells.Encorafenibis one such drug used in colon cancer.

6. IMMUNOTHERAPY
6. Immunotherapy

This therapy involves the use of drugs that modulate the immune system. Drugs given during immunotherapy boost the immune system, which helps in fighting the cancer cells. It is mostly used in advanced stages of colon cancer. Some of the common examples are:
IpilimumabPembrolizumabNivolumab
