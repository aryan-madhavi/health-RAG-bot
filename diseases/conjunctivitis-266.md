CONJUNCTIVITIS
ConjunctivitisAlso known as pink eye, conjunctivitis infective, contagious ophthalmia
OVERVIEW
Overview
Conjunctivitis is an infection of conjunctiva, a transparent membrane that lines the eyelid and covers the white part of your eyeball. When small blood vessels in the conjunctiva become inflamed, they become more prominent. This is what causes the whites of your eyes to appear reddish or pink, hence the name pink eye.

Conjunctivitis is marked by burning and itching in the eyes along with mucus or pus discharge. There is a constant urge to rub the affected eye and in some cases pain may also be present. It may be caused due to certain infectious agents such as viruses, bacteria or non-infectious causes such as dust, fumes or other allergens. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by physical examination by your doctor and treatment depends upon the infective cause of the condition. While viral conjunctivitis does not require any treatment, bacterial infection may require anti-infective agents in the form of eye drops or ointments.


You can prevent conjunctivitis by keeping your hands clean and avoid sharing personal belongings such as eyewear, eyedrops, makeup with infected individuals. Cautious use of contact lenses is also important to prevent contracting this infection. Conjunctivitis, which gets worse with each passing day, should be taken seriously and treated by an ophthalmologist as it poses a risk of complications such as uveitis and corneal perforation.

CAUSES OF CONJUNCTIVITIS
Causes Of Conjunctivitis


Conjunctivitis may be caused by pathogens such as bacteria,viruses or some allergens and irritants. Some of the most common causes of conjunctivitis are described below:


1. INFECTIOUS CAUSES OF CONJUNCTIVITIS
1. Infectious causes of conjunctivitis
These types of conjunctivitis are contagious ie. They can easily spread from an infected person or by something an infected person has touched, such as a used tissue. The various types of infectious causes are as follows:
Bacterial conjunctivitisis very common in children and some of the common bacterias responsible for conjunctivitis are Staphylococcal species such as Staphylococcus aureus, H. influenza, S. pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae cause conjunctivitis in adults.Viral conjunctivitisis also quite common in adults. This type of conjunctivitis is very contagious and often spreads in schools and other crowded places. Viruses such as Adenoviruses, Herpes simplex, Herpes zoster, and Enterovirus are known to cause conjunctivitis.
2. NON-INFECTIOUS CAUSES OF CONJUNCTIVITIS
2. Non-infectious causes of conjunctivitis
These conjunctivitis are not contagious and are usually caused by some allergen or irritant:
Allergic conjunctivitisis the body's reaction to allergens or allergic substances. It affects both eyes and is a response to an allergy causing substance such as pollens, dust mites, molds, dander from pets, medicines or cosmetics etc. Allergic conjunctivitis is more common in people with other allergic conditions, like hay fever, asthma, and eczema. One may also experience symptoms like sneezing and watery nasal discharge along with symptoms of conjunctivitis.
Giant papillary conjunctivitisis a type of allergic conjunctivitis caused by the long term presence of a foreign body in the eye. People who wear inflexible contact lenses, use soft contact lenses that are not changed frequently or have a prosthetic eye are more prone to develop this kind of conjunctivitis.
Irritant conjunctivitisis caused by irritants like smoke, dust, fumes. Toxins like chemicals from the chemical industry or the chemicals/gases used in a laboratory or caustic materials like bleach can cause conjunctivitis and in some cases a chemical splash can lead to permanent damage to the eye as well.Did you know?The Coronavirus that has caused the COVID -19 Pandemic has been found to cause conjunctivitis as well.
