SLEEPWALKING
SleepwalkingAlso known as Somnambulism
OVERVIEW
Overview
Sleepwalking, a condition frequently observed in children, is a sleeping disorder characterized by unusual activities  such as standing, walking, talking, eating, screaming, dressing, going to the bathroom, or even leaving the house during deep sleep.

The episode generally lasts for a few minutes, and there is no subsequent memory of the activities after waking up. Risk factors include sleep deprivation, stress, repeated nighttime awakenings, and a family history of the disorder.

Sleepwalking can lead to dangerous consequences such as self-injury by accidentally falling from a height, touching sharp objects, or trying to drive. The more intense and frequent episode requires medical treatment.

Keeping sharp objects out of reach, keeping doors and windows closed, and using door or bed alarms are proven to be helpful in preventing injuries during episodes.

SYMPTOMS OF SLEEPWALKING
Symptoms Of Sleepwalking

Sleepwalking is a parasomnia, which is an undesired movement during sleep. Despite the name, sleepwalking is not limited to only walking while sleeping. It can involve several other strange and inappropriate activities while sleeping, such as:Sitting with open eyes, having a blank lookDoing routine activities such as brushing teeth and getting dressedHaving a glazed expressionFacing difficulty in waking upHaving a feeling of confusionReturning to bed suddenlyTalking or shouting while walkingHaving sleep terrorsRunningEatingEngaging in sexual behavior (sexsomnia)Urinating in inappropriate placesTrying to escape from a threat that is dreamed or imagined


It's important to note that these sleepwalking episodes are typically short-lived, lasting from a few seconds to half an hour. One of the most distinctive features of sleepwalking is the inability to recall the incident upon waking up, adding to its mysterious nature.

In rare cases, a person can do violent behavior that can prove to be risky. Such behavior includes:Trying to drive a carLeaving the houseClimbing out of a windowAttacking the other person involved in wakingDid you know?

Sleepwalking has been a topic of fascination since ancient Greece. In their writings, Hippocrates and Aristotle made allusions to it. Shakespeare utilized it to portray a character in Macbeth, and the plot of the novel Dracula is set in motion by a sleepwalker.
CAUSES OF SLEEPWALKING
Causes Of Sleepwalking

Human beings have two phases of the sleep cycle. Each phase varies in muscle tone, brain functions, and eye movements.
Non-rapid eye movement (NREM): These stages of deeper sleep progressively shift from N1 to N3. Approximately 75% of sleep is spent in the NREM stages.
N1 (light sleep)- 5% of sleep
N2 (deeper sleep)- 25%
N3 (deepest sleep)- 45%

Note:Sleepwalking, night terrors, and bedwetting occur in the N3 stage.

Rapid eye movement (REM): This stage is not considered the restful stage of sleep. REM is associated with dreaming and usually starts after 90 minutes of sleeping. The main characteristic of REM is irregular muscle movements, including eye movements. About 25% of an individual's sleep duration is REM.
WHAT CAUSES SLEEPWALKING?

What causes sleepwalking?
The brain controls all the phases of sleep. There are various theories stating the causes of sleepwalking. These include:
It is suggested that a lack of brain supply in the brain can disturb the sleep cycle, which may contribute to sleepwalking
Dysregulation in the sleep/wake cycles in the maturation phase of sleep causes sleepwalking
WHAT HAPPENS DURING THE N3 PHASE THAT TRIGGERS SLEEPWALKING?

What happens during the N3 phase that triggers sleepwalking?
The brain activities are the slowest during the N3 phase, also known as slow-wave sleep. It occurs in two cycles. Sleepwalkers have an abnormality in the transition phase from the NREM cycle to wakefulness. In this transition state, it is almost impossible to wake up the individual. This shifting phase also has a high arousal threshold, mental confusion, and unclear perception, which are the signs of sleepwalking.
INTERESTING FACT!

Interesting fact!
Men experience more nighttime awakenings than women because they spend more time in the N1 stage of sleep. However, women find it difficult to fall asleep because they maintain slow-wave sleep for longer than men.
RISK FACTORS FOR SLEEPWALKING
Risk factors For Sleepwalking

Sleepwalking occurs during deep sleep. Any factor that triggers physical activity while mainly remaining asleep is a risk for sleepwalking. These factors include:

2. FAMILY HISTORY
2. Family history
Persons having a family history of sleepwalking are more prone to develop this condition. As per some studies, individuals with a first-degree relative of sleepwalking are ten times more likely to develop sleepwalking.
Identical twins also have a higher chance of developing sleepwalking than non-identical twins.
3. SLEEP DEPRIVATION

3. Sleep deprivation
Lack of sleep also increases the risk of developing sleepwalking. This is because of the longer duration spent in deep sleep.

DIAGNOSIS OF SLEEPWALKING
Diagnosis Of Sleepwalking

There are no specific tests to diagnose sleep talking. However, the following aid in diagnosing the condition:
1. MEDICAL HISTORY
1. Medical history
A thorough medical history is necessary to assess the condition. The doctor may ask questions regarding the following:Another sleep disorderMedical conditionMedication useMental health disorderSubstance abuse
2. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
2. Physical examination
The physician may conduct a physical examination to differentiate sleepwalking from other conditions, such as nocturnal seizures, alternative sleep disorders, or panic episodes that may present similarly and affect the sleep cycle.
It is also done to look out for any signs of injury.
3. MAINTAINING A SLEEP DIARY

3. Maintaining a sleep diary
The doctor generally asks that a sleep diary be maintained for at least two weeks. The diary serves as a tool for monitoring sleep habits and patterns and helps reveal how sleep affects daily activities.

What information does a sleep diary contain?
A sleep diary contains all the related information and other details that may alter sleep quality, such as medications, alcohol, and food habits.BedtimeWake-up timeHow long it takes to fall asleepThe number and duration of sleep interruptionsThe number and duration of daytime napsPerceived sleep qualityConsumption of alcohol, caffeine, and tobaccoDaily medicationsDaily exercise
4.ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY (EEG)

4.Electroencephalography (EEG)
Electroencephalography (EEG) measures brain activity using metallic discs attached to the scalp. Since the brain governs sleep, investigating brain alterations can facilitate the identification of sleepwalking causes.
5. POLYSOMNOGRAPHY

5. Polysomnography
It includes an examination of the quality of sleep using a sleep study. A sleep study records the brain's activities, heart rate, and breathing while sleeping. It also assesses sleeping behavior, such as moving arms and legs or doing any unusual activity.

Polysomnography is not used for routine sleepwalking diagnosis. In most cases, medical history and reports from self or others are sufficient to make a diagnosis.
