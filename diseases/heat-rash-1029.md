HEAT RASH
Heat rashAlso known as Prickly heat, Sweat rash and Eccrine miliaria
OVERVIEW
Overview
Heat rash, is a common heat-related disorder that occurs when the skin's sweat glands become blocked and swell, leading to inflammation and discomfort. It is characterized by small, itchy bumps or blisters, redness, and a prickling or stinging sensation on the skin.

Heat rash typically occurs in hot and humid weather, and is more common in areas with high temperatures and humidity. It can affect anyone, regardless of age or gender, and is often seen in individuals who engage in strenuous activities, wear tight clothing, or are exposed to extreme temperatures.

The condition is usually self-limiting, but can lead to complications such as infection, abscesses, or cellulitis if left untreated. Prompt recognition and management are essential to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications, and ensure optimal outcomes.

SYMPTOMS OF HEAT RASH
Symptoms Of Heat Rash

Symptoms of heat rash can vary in severity and usually appear where sweat accumulates, including armpits, neck, upper chest, groin, under the breasts, behind the knees and in elbow creases.

Common symptoms of heat rash include:Itching or prickling sensationMild swellingRed clusters of pimples or small blistersRed, inflamed skin


Note:In infants, heat rash frequently appears in skin folds, on the face and in the diaper area.

TYPES OF HEAT RASH
Types of Heat Rash

Heat rash is a skin condition that comes from blocked sweat ducts. It is categorized based on the depth of the blocked sweat pores. There are four primary types:


1. Miliaria crystallina:The mildest and most common form, occurring when the top layer of the skin's pores becomes blocked. This type is characterized by clear, fluid-filled blisters and bumps.


2. Miliaria rubra:Known as prickly heat, this type causes an itchy, prickling sensation due to deeper blockage of sweat ducts.


3. Miliaria pustulosa:If miliaria rubra becomes infected or inflamed, the bumps can fill with pus, resulting in this form of heat rash.


4. Miliaria profunda:The least common type, occurring when sweat ducts in the dermis (deeper skin layer) are blocked, leading to firm, flesh-colored lesions that resemble goosebumps.
CAUSES OF HEAT RASH
Causes Of Heat Rash

Heat rash is usually caused by sweating a lot. It occurs when the ducts leading from sweat glands to the skin surface become blocked or inflamed. This blockage prevents sweat from evaporating and traps it beneath the skin, causing irritation and the formation of bumps.
Babies often get heat rash because they cannot control their temperature as well as adults and children can.

Several factors can contribute to the clogging of sweat glands, including:
Small pieces of dead skin cells or skin secretions block the glands.
Excessive sweat buildup between skin and clothing.
Hair follicles obstruct the glands.
Hormonal changes, such as during menstruation.
Insufficient airflow between the skin and clothing.
RISK FACTORS FOR HEAT RASH
Risk Factors For Heat Rash

Prickly heat, or heat rash, often stems from sweating and certain environmental conditions. Here are the key factors contributing to its development:

Newborns:Immature sweat ducts in newborns make them susceptible to heat rash.


Hot and humid weather:Living or working in hot and humid environments increases the likelihood of heat rash.


Physical activity:Engaging in intense exercise or activities that induce sweating can trigger prickly heat.


Fever:Elevated body temperature, such as during a fever, can lead to heat rash.


Clothing choices:Wearing non-breathable or synthetic clothing that traps heat and sweat against the skin can contribute to heat rash.


Hospitalization:Patients confined to hospital beds, especially those on waterproof mattresses or mattress protectors, are at higher risk.


Other conditions:Certain diseases, medications, and medical treatments may also increase the likelihood of developing heat rash. These include drug-inducedhyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), adverse reactions to medications like chemotherapy, genetic disorders, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, radiotherapy etc.
DIAGNOSIS OF HEAT RASH
Diagnosis Of Heat Rash

Diagnosing heat rash typically involves a combination of medical history, physical examination, and sometimes additional tests. Here's how it's typically done:

1. Medical history:Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, including when they started, where they're located, and any factors that may have triggered them, such as exposure to heat or sweating.

2. Physical examination:Your doctor will examine the affected skin, looking for characteristic signs of heat rash, such as red bumps, blisters, or irritated areas.

3. Dermoscopy:Dermoscopy is a valuable tool, especially in individuals with darker skin, as it can reveal large white globules with surrounding darker halos, resembling a white bullseye.

4. Skin punch biopsy:In cases of uncertainty or when the diagnosis is difficult, a skin punch biopsy may be performed to aid in diagnosis.

5. High-definition optical coherence tomography (OCT):High-definition OCT has helped identify the obstruction of the eccrine duct, assisting in the diagnosis of miliaria (or heat rash).

PREVENTION OF HEAT RASH
Prevention Of Heat Rash

The primary treatment for heat rash is prevention. Allowing the skin to be exposed to circulating air reduces the likelihood of sweat duct blockage and gland inflammation.


Strategies to prevent heat rash include:
STAY COOL AND BREATHE EASY
Stay Cool and Breathe Easy
Dress smart:Wear loose, lightweight, light-colored clothing from breathable cotton fabrics.
Avoid sweat traps:Skip tight-fitting clothes, wool, and thick creams that can clog pores.
Take cool showers or baths:This helps regulate body temperature and prevent sweat buildup.
Seek shade and air conditioning:Limit time outdoors during peak heat hours (10 am - 4 pm) and find cool spaces whenever possible.
HYDRATE AND BE SUN SAFE:

Hydrate and Be Sun Safe:
Drink plenty of water:Stay hydrated to help your body sweat effectively and cool down.
Protect yourself from the sun:Seek shade, wear a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, and SPF 30+ sunscreen with UVA/UVB protection and water resistance.

REDUCE ACTIVITY AND IRRITATION:
Reduce Activity and Irritation:
Limit strenuous exercise in hot weather:Opt for cooler times of the day or air-conditioned spaces.
Minimize skin-on-skin contact:This can trap sweat and increase irritation, especially for those with excess weight.
Avoid Blocking Pores:Refrain from using creams and ointments that can block pores.
Avoid medications that cause sweating:Consult your doctor if you take medications like clonidine, beta-blockers, or opioids, as they may worsen heat rash.

PREVENTING BABY HEAT RASH
Preventing Baby Heat Rash
To help your baby avoid heat rash, follow these steps:Monitor overheating:When at the park or playground, ensure your baby isn't overheating. If you notice damp clothing or flushed skin, remove a layer or move to a shady or cool area.

Hydration:Keep your baby hydrated with frequent breaks for milk or water, helping to maintain a healthy body temperature.

Layer wisely:Dress your baby in breathable, moisture-wicking layers that allow sweat to evaporate. Avoid adding too many layers to prevent trapping heat and sweat.

Proper sleepwear:Choose snug-fitting, flame-retardant sleepwear made from natural fibres like cotton to allow heat and sweat to dissipate.

Re-rinse laundry:Add an extra rinse cycle or adjust detergent levels to remove residue that can cause skin irritation and heat rashes.

COMPLICATIONS OF HEAT RASH
Complications Of Heat Rash

Complications of heat rash, also known as miliaria, can include:

Anhidrosis:Severe heat rash can damage sweat glands, leading to anhidrosis (inability to sweat), which hampers the body's ability to cool down.

Heat Exhaustion:Without proper sweating, the body's temperature regulation is impaired, increasing the risk of heat exhaustion.

Skin Infections:Persistent scratching can break the skin, leading to bacterial infections like impetigo.Did our information help you?In our relentless endeavour to keep improving our services, you are our eyes.
