DRY SKIN
Dry SkinAlso known as Xeroderma, Xerosis, Xerosis cutis and Asteatosis
OVERVIEW
Overview
Dry skin refers to rough, flaky, itchy, or scaly skin. It is caused by disturbed skin barrier and lack of natural lipids in the skin. Dry skin can be seasonal or can develop due to some underlying medical conditions such as dermatitis,psoriasis,hypothyroidism,hyperthyroidism,diabetes, etc.

The symptoms of dry skin can be triggered by using harsh cleansers, cold weather, and frequent exposure of water. The people who are working in certain occupations such as catering, hairdressings, healthcare, construction, woodwork, and rubber industry are at higher risk of developing dry skin due to continuous exposure to water and harsh chemicals. Stress, anxiety, and lack of water intake can also make the skin more prone to dryness.

Dry skin can be easily managed and treated through self care and medical help. Keeping the skin moist through moisturizer and protecting the skin from sun round the year are the fundamental keys to manage it. Wearing loose cotton clothes over tight synthetic fabrics are also of great help.

If not treated timely, dry skin can make it more prone to infections, severe itching and more severe skin conditions likeeczema, contact dermatitis etc.

3. CRACKING
3. Cracking

Peeling refers to the renewal of the uppermost layer of skin – epidermis. It is a natural process to shed dead skin cells. Dry skin increases the shedding process which causes skin to peel off easily.
8. SKIN INFECTIONS
8. Skin infections
The people affected with dry skin are more prone to skin infections due to the breaks and cracks in the skin. The cracks allow the penetration of microbes inside the skin that can lead to infections such as fungal skin infections.

CAUSES OF DRY SKIN
Causes Of Dry Skin

Before understanding the causes of dry skin, it is important to know the structure and composition of skin:
The natural skin barrier consists of specialized cells known as corneocytes. These corneocytes are fixed in the lipid rich layer of the skin. The disturbance in the size, number, and arrangement of corneocytes impairs the skin barrier.
The normal skin should be able to store 10-20% of water content. The changes in water holding capacity, both too high and too low also affects the skin barrier.
The composition of lipids in the uppermost layer is also affected by various factors like age, genetic disposition, diet (e.g., percentage of essential fatty acids) as well as drugs (e.g., cholesterol-lowering agents).

Dry skin is caused due to disturbance in this natural barrier function and/or lack of moisturizing factors in the skin. The various causes that can either alter the lipid composition or can decrease the content of moisturizing factors can be grouped as:
A. EXTERNAL CAUSES
A. External causes

1. Skin cleansing:Excessive exposure to water can remove natural oils from the skin, making it dry. The following daily activities can cause it:
Frequently taking long hot showers
Excessive scrubbing of the skin
Frequent washing of the hands
Using harsh soaps
Using alkaline soaps and detergents
Excessive use of sanitizers

2. Environmental factors:Some environmental factors can also cause dry skin. These include:
Living in cold weather where humidity is low
Intense exposure to sunlight
Using air conditioning system

3. Occupational factors:Some people have constant exposure to the agents that remove moisture from the skin and cause dry skin. This includes people working in hairdressings, housekeeping, catering, metal workers, construction, agriculture etc. Healthcare professionals are also at increased risk of dry skin because they have to wash their hands frequently.
B. INTERNAL CAUSES
B. Internal causes
These are the uncontrollable factors and include various disorders that can cause dry skin. This can be:

1. Dermatological causes

Inflammatory skin disorders:There are various skin disorders that can cause dry skin such as :
Atopic dermatitis

Perioral dermatitis
Dyshidrotic eczema
Nummular eczema
Psoriasis
Scabies
Skin infections
Xeroderma pigmentosum
Cutaneous T cell lymphoma
Lichen planus
Urticaria
Drug eruptions

Genodermatoses:It refers to rare inherited skin diseases that can influence the texture, color and structure of skin depending upon the type. Common example include ichthyosis in which the skin becomes severely dry.

Infectious dermatose:These are the skin conditions that are caused by bacteria, virus, fungi, or parasites. In the chronic stage, they also cause dry skin. The disease includes pediculosis andscabies.

Neoplasms:Some forms of cancers such as cutaneous lymphoma (cancer of white blood cells) can also cause dry skin.

According toThe National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, heavy  drinking refers to :
Females:More than 3 drinks per day or more than 7 drinks per week.
Males:More than 4 drinks per day or more than 14 drinks per week.

Cleansers play a key role in changing the skin texture. Soaps and detergents should be wisely chosen. Syndet cleansers are shown to reduce itching as they are less irritating than traditional soaps. The people having dry skin should avoid traditional soaps as they can worsen the skin conditions. Medicated soaps prescribed by the doctor should be used in case of severely damaged skin.

Wear gloves
The over exposure of the skin to the water removes the natural oil from the skin and makes it dry. It also reduces the effect of moisturizer. It is wise to wear gloves while doing activities such as washing dishes, gardening, cooking etc.

Wearing gloves in the winter also keeps the skin warm and prevents the skin from drying.
