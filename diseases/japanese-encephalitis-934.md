JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS
Japanese encephalitisAlso Known as Japanese B Encephalitis, JE, Russian Autumnal Encephalitis, and Summer Encephalitis
OVERVIEW
Overview
Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic viral disease caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Mosquitoes transmit the virus from animals, especially pigs and birds like cattle egrets, pond herons, etc., to humans. The virus is not transmitted from one person to another.

Japanese encephalitis (JE) is most commonly seen in Asia and the western Pacific countries. It primarily affects children and occasionally adults.

Most people infected with JE do not have symptoms or have only mild symptoms, and treatment involves supporting the body's functions as it tries to fight off the infection.
However, a small percentage of infected people can develop inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), with symptoms like sudden onset ofheadache, highfever, disorientation, coma, tremors, and convulsions.

Prevention generally consists of avoiding mosquito bites by using insect repellents, wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants, etc. Getting vaccinated for JE is also important, especially while living in or traveling to JE-endemic areas.

CAUSES OF JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS
Causes Of Japanese Encephalitis


Japanese encephalitis is caused by a flavivirus, which can affect both humans and animals. Understanding the transmission cycle is very important in knowing the cause.
TRANSMISSION
Transmission
This virus exists in the zoonotic transmission cycle, which means the infections spread from animals, through insects to humans. The general carriers and hosts of this virus are:


Mosquitoes:The major mosquito vectors of JEV vary in different geographic regions. Culicine mosquitoes, mainly the Vishnui group of Culex, are the chief vectors of JE in different parts of India.


Pigs:Pigs serve as an amplifier host since they allow virus multiplication manifold without suffering from disease and maintain prolonged high levels of virus. Due to this, mosquitoes get the opportunity to get infected from pigs easily.


Water birds belonging to the family Ardeidae (cattle egrets and pond herons):Ardeidae birds are important maintenance hosts.


Humans:Humans are the end host in the transmission cycle. Mosquitoes do not get infections from JE patients. There is no human-to-human transmission of JE.


Note:In most temperate areas of Asia, JEV is transmitted mainly during the warm season. In the tropics and subtropical regions, transmission can occur year-round but often intensifies during the rainy season and pre-harvest period in rice-cultivating regions.Did you know?

DIAGNOSIS OF JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS
Diagnosis Of Japanese Encephalitis


Individuals who live in or have traveled to a JE-endemic area and experience encephalitis are considered a suspected JE case. Confirming the diagnosis consists of the following:


1. DETAILED MEDICAL AND TRAVEL HISTORY
1. Detailed medical and travel history
Individuals who have recently traveled to or resided in regions endemic to JE are suspected of infection with JEV.
JE should be considered in a patient with
Acute onset of fever not more than 7 days duration and
Change in mental status which may be
New onset of seizures (excluding febrile seizures) or
Other early clinical findings include irritability or abnormal behavior greater than usual febrile illness.


2. LABORATORY TESTS
2. Laboratory testsCerebrospinal fluid(CSF):It detects JE by testing for specific IgM antibodies, which typically appear 3–8 days after symptom onset.

Peripheral smear examination:This test identifies signs of infection such as lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated white blood cell count, although it is not specific for JE.


3. SEROLOGICAL TESTS
3. Serological TestsPlaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT):PRNT is a gold standard for diagnosing flavivirus infections. It confirms JE by detecting a fourfold increase in IgG titers in acute and convalescent sera.

Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA):MAC-ELISA is the first-line test for acute JE infections, detecting JE-specific IgM antibodies.

Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) Test:This test measures antibody response to a virus by using hemagglutinin proteins that bind to red blood cells.

Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA):It detects antibodies by their reaction with viral antigens on infected cells, visualized with fluorescently labeled antibodies.

Nucleic Acid Amplification (RT-PCR):RT-PCR tests are sensitive and specific for detecting low viral levels in the early phase of infection.

Staphylococcal Coagglutination Test:This rapid test uses monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to detect JE quickly.

TREATMENT OF JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS
Treatment Of Japanese Encephalitis

Currently, there is no specific treatment for JE that can directly target the virus. Hence, the management is essentially supportive care to relieve symptoms and complications.
Therefore, the management of JE primarily focuses on supportive care to relieve symptoms and complications:
SUPPORTIVE CARE
Supportive care
Medications for fever and pain relief
Acetaminophen (paracetamol)may be given to manage fever, headache or body aches.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are usually avoided because of risk of bleeding complications.
Fluid management
Adequate hydration is crucial, especially if the patient has high fever, vomiting, or diarrhea.
I.V. (Intravenous) fluids may be administered if required.
HOSPITALIZATION

Hospitalization
Severe cases often require hospitalization for stabilisation, close monitoring, and medical care. This is especially important for patients with severe or neurological complications.


Research is ongoing into various antiviral treatments for JE, but they are yet to be proven effective in clinical settings so far.

COMPLICATIONS OF JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS
Complications Of Japanese Encephalitis

Some of the common complications include:Seizures:JE is associated with seizures in 46% of the patients in the acute stage of encephalitis.

Increased intracranial pressure:Growing pressure inside of the skull due to seizures in case of JE.

Status epilepticus:A seizure that lasts longer than 5 minutes, or has more than 1 seizure within 5 minutes, without returning to a normal level of consciousness between episodes.

Parkinson's-like symptoms:Symptoms like the mask‐like face, rigidity, and tremor. However, acute flaccid paralysis can be a presenting symptom.

Acute encephalitis:It is a severe inflammation of the brain that can lead to symptoms such as fever, confusion, and neurological impairments.

Aspiration pneumonia:Occurs when food, saliva, liquids, or vomit is breathed into the lungs or airways leading to the lungs, instead of being swallowed into the esophagus and stomach. This is due to reduced gag reflex in patients with JE.
