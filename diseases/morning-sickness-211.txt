MORNING SICKNESS
Morning sicknessAlso known as Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP)
OVERVIEW
Overview
Morning sickness is a common symptom experienced during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. Despite the name, it can occur at any time of the day. It typically involvesnausea, with or without vomiting, and affects about 70–80% of pregnant women.


Though the exact cause is not fully understood, it's believed to be linked to hormonal changes, particularly due to rising levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and estrogen hormones.Tirednessor fatigue,stress, and strong smells can also trigger symptoms.


For most, morning sickness is mild and manageable with lifestyle changes like eating small, frequent meals, staying hydrated, and avoiding trigger foods. However, in severe cases, called hyperemesis gravidarum, it can lead todehydrationand weight loss and may require medical treatment.


While unpleasant, mild morning sickness is usually not harmful to the baby and is often considered a sign of a healthy pregnancy. Symptoms typically improve by the second trimester.

CAUSES OF MORNING SICKNESS
Causes Of Morning Sickness

Morning sickness occurs due to several changes in the body during early pregnancy. These include:

Hormonal surge:Pregnancy hormones like hCG and estrogen spike early on and can irritate the parts of your brain that control nausea.

Slowed digestion:Progesterone relaxes your stomach muscles, slowing digestion and causing that queasy, full feeling.

Brain-gut communication:Some signals from your growing placenta (like GDF15) can trigger the brain's vomiting center.

Protective instinct:Some experts think this is nature’s way of helping you avoid potentially harmful foods early in pregnancy.



Could morning sickness be due to something other than pregnancy?
Not all nausea in pregnancy is just morning sicknessConditions likegastroesophageal reflux disease (acid reflux)orindigestioncan cause similar symptoms, especially in the first trimesterIn some cases, infections like Helicobacter pylori may be involved.If symptoms are severe, your doctor may suggest testing and treatment during pregnancy.Did You Know?
Acid reflux affects up to 85% of pregnant women, often due to hormonal changes and growing pressure on the stomach. Always consult your doctor before taking any medicine during pregnancy.
