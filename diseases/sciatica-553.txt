SCIATICA
SciaticaAlso known as Lumbosacral radicular syndrome, Ischias, Nerve root pain, and Nerve root entrapment.
OVERVIEW
Overview

Sciatica is a serious condition that results from pressure on the sciatic nerve, the largest nerve in the human body, formed by the union of 5 nerves from the lower part of the spine. The most common cause of sciatica is related to discs like disc herniation or bony overgrowths. Causes not related to the disc may include cancer, infections, or compression of the blood vessels.

Individuals with sciatica experience pain, numbness, pricking or stabbing sensation, and muscle weakness in the sciatic nerve distribution. Sciatica pain often is worsened by twisting, bending, or coughing. Sciatica may be triggered by improper posture, too long standing or sitting in the same place, obesity, and increased height.

This condition is usually seen in older adults. Women are more commonly affected by men. Severe injury to the nerve can cause a drop foot effect, i.e. difficulty lifting the front part of the foot. Other complications may include loss of bowel and bladder control.

Treatment generally varies depending on the severity and cause of the condition. Various management protocols include conservative treatment like staying active, painkillers, acupuncture, epidural steroid injections, spinal manipulation, and physical therapy. Surgery may be required in severe cases.

SYMPTOMS OF SCIATICA
Symptoms Of Sciatica

The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve that branches from the lower back through your hips, buttocks, and down each leg. Sciatica presents itself with pain along the pathway of the nerve, including the lower back, buttock, and the back of the thigh and calf. The symptoms include:

Unilateral leg pain
Pain in the lower back
Radiating pain to foot or toes
Numbness and burning in the distribution of the nerve
Increased pain in keeping the lag straight
Decreased range of motion of the hip joint.
CAUSES OF SCIATICA
Causes Of Sciatica

Sciatica symptoms occur when there is pathology anywhere along the course of the nerves. Sciatica develops in many ways; among them, the most common are the following:

Herniated discs:This condition occurs when the soft center of a spinal disc pushes through a crack in the more rigid exterior casing of the spine.

Degenerative disc disease:It is a natural aging process that acts as a precursor to disc herniation.

Lumbar (lower back) spinal stenosis:It is the narrowing of the sciatic nerve

Isthmic spondylolisthesis:This condition results from the vertebra slipping forward on the sacral, pinching the nerve root as it leaves the spine.

Piriformis syndrome:This occurs when your piriformis muscle (muscle in the gluteal region of the lower limbs) compresses the sciatic nerve and results in swelling and redness.

Malignancy (cancer):Metastatic (spreading) bone or soft tissue cancer, sciatic nerve cancer, hemangioblastoma (type of brain tumor)

Infection:That can lead to abscess formation and inflammation of the disc.

Vascular compression:Compression of the blood vessels can lead to the formation of a pseudoaneurysm (occurs when blood walls of the blood vessels are injured).

Bony compression: Overgrowth of bones in the sciatic nerve distribution can put pressure on it.

Gynecological cause:Studieshave shown that uterine fibroid andendometriosis(overgrowth of the inner lining of the uterus) can also cause sciatica.

RISK FACTORS FOR SCIATICA
Risk Factors For Sciatica

Sciatica may be caused due to reasons related to the disc or non-discogenic causes. However, your chances of getting sciatica increase with the following factors:

AGE
Age
As you age, the changes in your spine can lead to bony overgrowths and herniated discs, the most common causes of sciatica.

GENETIC PREDISPOSITION
Genetic predisposition
Studiessuggest that lumbar disc disorders, characterized by disc herniation, have a vital genetic component that can lead to sciatica.


OCCUPATION
Occupation
Particularly if associated with physical activity, especially flexion/torsion of the trunk, arms frequently raised above shoulder height, and driving motor vehicles.

INCORRECT WALKING POSTURE
Incorrect walking posture
While walking, your shoulders should be back, down, and relaxed, as improper posture can compress your lumbar discs and cause sciatic nerve irritation.

JOGGING
Jogging
It can predispose you to pain if you have a history of back or lumbar problems.Researchshows that joggers have a lower risk for incidental sciatic pain but a higher risk for persistent symptoms.

SMOKING
Smoking
Studiesdemonstrate that smoking is a modest risk factor for lumbar pain and clinically verified sciatica.

DIAGNOSIS OF SCIATICA
Diagnosis Of Sciatica

Sciatic pain can mimic any other nerve pain, and it is essential to diagnose it correctly for the proper treatment. Sciatica is mainly diagnosed by the following:

MEDICAL HISTORY
Medical History

A complete history is required to determine the localization, severity, loss of strength, sensibility disorders, duration, course, influence of coughing, rest, or movement, and consequences for daily activities.

Patients generally mention radiating pain in the leg with sensory symptoms like numbness, burning, or tingling. They may be asked to show the distribution of the pain and whether it radiates below the knee.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Physical examination

It largely depends on neurological testing. The most applied investigation is the straight leg raising test or Lasègue’s sign. Lasègue’s sign is positive if the angle to which the leg can be raised (upon straight leg raising) before complaining of pain is <45°.

Note:Patients with sciatica may also have lower back pain, which is usually less severe than leg pain.

IMAGING TESTS
Imaging tests

Imaging may be indicated at this stage only if indications or “red flags” like infections, cysts, tumors, or fractures, rather than disc herniation. These tests include:

X-ray:Radiographs of the spine may reveal any overgrowth of bone that can be pressing on a nerve.

CT scan: A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan may be performed to evaluate fracture if plain radiographs are negative. CT is also done to assess any soft tissue anomalies.

MRI:Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indicated if the pain is persistent for more than 6-8 weeks to rule out any neurologic deficit is present or a mass effect is suspected.

Electromyography (EMG):It is a minimally invasive diagnostic test that evaluates how well the electrical signals between nerves and muscles are working. It is done to determine the severity of nerve damage.

TREATMENT OF SCIATICA
Treatment Of Sciatica
While sciatica may not be a life-threatening disease, it can severely affect the quality of life, taking a toll on the mind and body. Various treatment options of sciatica include:

CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT
Conservative management

This consists of explaining the cause of the symptoms and reassuring the patients that symptoms usually diminish over time, even without specific measures. Advise them to stay active and continue daily activities with yoga or stretches to relieve the pain.

PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT
Pharmacological management
If there is a lot of pain, certain medications are prescribed to provide relief. These include:

1.Anticonvulsant medications:Researchsupports the use of anticonvulsants that can relieve pain caused by damaged nerves. These include:
Gabapentin
Pregabalin

2.Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs): TCAs are the moststudiedantidepressants for the treatment of pain related to the nerves.Amitriptylineis most commonly used for management of sciatica.

3.SNRIs: Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) are antidepressants that help relieve depression symptoms and are also used for anxiety disorders and nerve pain. The drugs used in sciatica include:
Duloxetine
Venlafaxine

4.Opioid analgesics:These are used for pain relief and include:
Oxycodone
Tramadol
Morphine sulfate(MST)

5.Epidural steroid injections:These can temporarily relieve sciatica and help a patient progress with rehab and exercise.

SURGERY
Surgery

Surgical intervention for sciatica focuses on removing herniated discs and, eventually, part of the disc to eliminate the suspected cause of sciatica. Treatment is aimed at easing the leg pain and corresponding symptoms, not reducing the back pain.

Studiessuggest that cauda equina syndrome (compression of a collection of nerve roots) is an absolute indication for immediate surgery. Elective surgery is the choice for unilateral sciatica. Surgeries include:

Microdiscectomy:This is a minimally invasive surgical procedure performed on individuals with a herniated lumbar disc.

Laminectomy:It is a surgery that creates space by removing bone spurs and tissues associated with arthritis of the spine.

EPIDURIOSCOPY WITH ADHESIOLYSIS
Epidurioscopy with adhesiolysis

Epidural endoscopic adhesiolysis is a minimally invasive technique for accurately placing the drug injection (generally a local anesthetic) into the epidural space.Studiesdemonstrate that this technique alleviates pain and reduces sensory nerve dysfunction in patients suffering from sciatica.
