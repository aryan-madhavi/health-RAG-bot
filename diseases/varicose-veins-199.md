VARICOSE VEINS
Varicose veinsAlso known as Varicosity, Venous blood vessels, and Vena
OVERVIEW
Overview

Varicose veins are abnormal, dilated blood vessels caused by a weakening of the walls of the blood vessels. They may appear as swollen, twisted clusters of blue or purple veins. These occur because standing and walking increases the pressure in the veins of the lower body.

Varicose can appear anywhere, but most often appear on the legs, in the pelvic area, and on the surface of the skin. Mild cases of varicose veins just produce leg discomfort and may just look aesthetically unpleasing but the severe form can lead to pain, swelling, itching bleeding, and eventually ulcer formation.

Older women are at a higher risk of developing varicose veins due to hormonal changes and loss of elasticity of the vein walls. Other risk factors can include prolonged standing or sitting, family history, and trauma.

Treatment might involve conservative or surgical management. Conservative management comprises self-care measures and compression therapy. Surgical or minimally invasive procedures are done by a healthcare provider to close or remove veins.

CAUSES OF VARICOSE VEINS
Causes Of Varicose Veins

Varicose veins may be caused by weakened valves within the veins that result in the pooling of blood in the veins instead of traveling to the heart. The causes of varicose veins can include:

Primary varicose veins:These can have a hereditary factor like weakness in the wall of the vein and occur in some members of the same family.

Secondary varicose veins:These develop because of secondary causes such as trauma or deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the deeper veins).

Familial and congenital varicose veins:These are due to disorders due to vascular malformation in the limb, present at birth.Did you know?There is a simple test that can detect the presence of blood clots and it's called the D-Dimer test.To Know More Click Here!
RISK FACTORS FOR VARICOSE VEINS
Risk Factors For Varicose Veins

The most important risk factors leading to the development of varicose veins are:
AGE
Age
This is due to the loss of elasticity of the tissues as a person gets older, causing the valve system to fail.
GENDER
Gender
Women have a higher incidence of varicose vein disease due to high levels of female hormones (estrogen) and their effect on the vein walls.
FAMILY HISTORY
Family history
Studiesshow that screening of parents and family members revealed if parents and grandparents had the problem, it will increase the risk of varicose veins irrespective of gender.
OBESITY
Obesity
Being overweight can put extra pressure on veins,studiesdemonstrate that the risk increases especially in overweight women.

ALCOHOL AND SMOKING

Alcohol and smoking
Studiesconcluded that alcohol is likely to increase the risk of varicose veins in women and smokers had a higher incidence of varicose veins compared with non-smokers in both genders.

HORMONAL CHANGES

Hormonal changes

These occur during different stages of life and include puberty, pregnancy, menopause, post-menopause, hormone replacement, and other medicines containing estrogen and progesterone that may contribute to the development of varicose veins.
PROLONGED STANDING
Prolonged standing
Occupations that involve prolonged standing increase the volume and pressure of blood in the lower legs due to the effects of gravity leading to the development of varicose veins.
IMMOBILITY
Immobility
Lack of mobility like sitting for a long time especially when legs are bent or crossed may force veins to work harder to pump blood to the heart increasing the risk of varicose veins formation.
PHYSICAL TRAUMA
Physical trauma
Trauma or damage to the underlying blood vessels is an important risk factor leading to the formation of varicose veins.
DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (DVT)
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
A DVT occurs when a blood clot forms in one or more of the deep veins in the body, especially in the legs. DVT significantly increases the risk of incidents of varicose veins.
TALL HEIGHT
Tall height
In both sexes, increasing height showed a significant relationship with varicose veins.

DIAGNOSIS OF VARICOSE VEINS
Diagnosis Of Varicose Veins

Diagnosing varicose veins requires a thorough history, physical examination, and series of tests. They include:
COMPLETE MEDICAL HISTORY

Complete medical history
This should include previous interventions or surgery on the affected leg, pregnancy, ulcerations, trauma, any history of uterine fibroids and cancer, previous DVT (deep vein thrombosis), past hospital stays, cardiovascular disease, and previous lower limb fracture.
CLINICAL EXAMINATION

Clinical examination
The clinical evaluation of varicose veins in the standing position and inspected for redness,
tenderness, swelling, hyperpigmentation, and ulcerations. Classification of venous reflux is used to assess the clinical severity of symptoms, it includes:

C0:No visible or palpable signs of venous disease
C1:Reticular veins (purple blue veins)
C2:Varicose veins
C3:Edema (swelling)
C4a:Pigmentation and itching
C4b:Changes in the skin of the lower legs and White scar as a result of healed ulcer
C5:Healed leg ulcer
C6:Active ulcer on the leg

To determine the exact cause the tests include:

Trendelenberg test:Also known as Brodie–Trendelenburg test, it determines the competency of the valves in the superficial and deep veins of the legs in patients with varicose veins. It is done by elevating the leg to 45º, and a tourniquet is applied to the midthigh after the veins have completely drained.

Perthes test:This is done in a standing position with a tourniquet applied to the midthigh. If the varicose veins collapse after a 5-minute walk or varicose veins become more prominent and painful with walking, then the deep veins are obstructed.

IMAGING TECHNIQUES
Imaging techniques
If the cause of varicose veins is not clear from the clinical examination or if an intervention is being considered then imaging tests are done. They include:

Venography:It is a procedure of an x-ray of the veins after a special dye is injected into the bone marrow or veins. It is done to find blood clots, and identify a vein for use to assess varicose veins before surgery.

Venous doppler test:This is an ultrasound scan to check the direction of blood flow in the veins and check if there are any blood clots in the veins.

Color duplex ultrasound scan:It involves using high-frequency sound waves to look at the speed of blood flow, and the structure of the veins in the legs.

Computed tomography (CT):It can help find deep, hidden varicose veins and even the root cause behind the symptoms.Studiesshow that CT venography can provide an excellent road map for varicose veins surgery.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):It can be used as an alternative tool that plays a better role in assessing varicose veins of the lower extremities and deep veins of the pelvis and abdomen.

CT Angiogram:This test can help your doctor confirm whether you have varicose veins or any other problem. A dye is injected that outlines your veins on x-ray images.

AMBULATORY VENOUS PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS
Ambulatory venous pressure measurements


It is used to detect the decline in pressure from a higher value in the leg veins. Ambulatory venous pressure (AMVP) measurement is considered the gold standard in evaluating calf pump function in chronic venous disease.

TREATMENT OF VARICOSE VEINS
Treatment Of Varicose Veins

Varicose veins treatment requires a correct understanding of the severity of symptoms. The treatment consists of the following:
CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT

Conservative management
For individuals with milder symptoms and who do not want to undergo surgery using long-term graduated compression stockings, leg elevation, and oral pain medications can be a means to relieve the symptoms. Stockings should be worn daily if you want to see results and avoid surgery.
SURGICAL MANAGEMENT
Surgical management
For patients with symptomatic veins and substantial venous incompetence, surgery has been the optimal treatment for many years. Traditional surgical treatment consisted of the following:

Conventional surgery:A small incision is made in the groin crease and the top of the main incompetent vein is dissected and tied off. A fine plastic wire is passed through the vein and retrieved through the inside of the leg at the knee level.
Vein stripping:This procedure is used to remove or tie off a large vein in the leg that helps treat varicose veins.
Radiofrequency and laser ablation:These involve passing a probe up the long vein from knee level to the groin under ultrasound guidance and then ablating the vein in sections. This avoids a groin incision and may lead to less bruising and quicker recovery.
Sclerotherapy:This involves the injection of an agent called sclerosant into varicosities, followed by a period of compression bandaging and/or compression hosiery. The main risk of sclerotherapy is injection outside the vein, which can result in local tissue necrosis and scarring.
Foam sclerotherapy:This involves mixing sclerosant with a small quantity of air to produce a foam that spreads rapidly and widely through the veins, pushing the blood aside and causing the veins to go into spasm.


MINIMALLY INVASIVE PROCEDURES
Minimally invasive procedures
Endovascular Laser Ablation( EVLA):This is a preferable treatment usually for larger varicose veins in which a thin catheter inserted into an enlarged vein heats the tip of the catheter using radiofrequency energy. As the catheter is pulled out, the heat destroys the vein by causing it to collapse and shut.
Micropuncture or micro-incision or stab phlebectomy:In this procedure, a physician makes a tiny incision and uses a surgical instrument or a large needle to hook the problem vein through the opening. The vein is then removed a tiny piece at a time.
Transilluminated powered phlebectomy:The procedure involves inserting a light under the skin while simultaneously injecting a mixture of saline and a local anesthetic that guides the surgeon to cut the vein into smaller pieces and suction the pieces from the space.


MANAGEMENT OF SPIDER VEINS
Management of spider veins
Many patients will have visible superficial veins referred to as "spider veins". These may not be a cause of worry just for cosmetic sake but can also be painful. Its management includes:

Liquid sclerotherapy:It involves the injection of a liquid sclerosant into the superficial veins.
Phlebectomy:It involves removing larger superficial varicose veins through small 2 mm to 3 mm incisions.
Laser therapy:Laser light can destroy the vein without damaging your skin. Laser therapy is only used to treat spider veins and is not useful for varicose veins.
