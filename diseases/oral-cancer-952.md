ORAL CANCER
Oral cancerAlso known as Oral Squamous cell carcinoma, Oral cavity cancer, and Oropharyngeal cancer
OVERVIEW
Overview

Oral cancer is the abnormal growth of cells in the mouth. It can affect the lips, cheeks, tongue, sinuses, and throat. Symptoms may include non-healing sores, difficulty swallowing, weight loss, and mouth pain.

Oral cancer is the sixth most common cancer globally. India contributes to nearly one-third of cases and ranks second in oral cancer burden. It primarily affects men over 45 years. Key risk factors include tobacco, betel-quid chewing, alcohol, poor oral hygiene, and HPV infections.

Treatment of oral cancer includes surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. It can also include targeted therapy or immunotherapy in advanced cases. Early diagnosis, quitting tobacco or alcohol, and maintaining good oral hygiene help improve treatment success.

CAUSES OF ORAL CANCER
Causes Of Oral Cancer


Oral cancer occurs when abnormal cells begin to grow within the oral cavity.
These abnormal cells develop because of changes (mutations) in their DNA.
This mutated DNA dictates the cells grow uncontrollably and continue living after normal cells die.
These masses of cells can form a tumor and when left untreated, these cells continue to grow out of control and spread to other parts of the body.
Numerous risk factors or possible causative agents for the development of oral cancer.

TYPES OF ORAL CANCER
Types Of Oral Cancer

There are multiple types of oral cancer and are generally categorized by the kind of cell cancer (carcinoma) starts to grow. They include:
1. SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA
1. Squamous cell carcinoma
This is the most common type of mouth cancer.
The earliest form of squamous cell cancer is called carcinoma in situ. This means the cancer cells are only in the top layer of cells lining cells.
2. ADENOCARCINOMA
2. Adenocarcinoma
It is a cancer that develops inside the tissue of the salivary gland, which grows from abnormalities in bone, cartilage, muscle, or other tissue.
3. HPV-RELATED CANCERS
3. HPV-related cancers
Infection with certain high-risk types of the human papillomavirus (HPV) causes most of the squamous cell cancers of the oropharynx (called HPV-positive cancer).
HPV is rarely associated with oral cavity cancer.
4. VERRUCOUS CARCINOMA
4. Verrucous carcinoma
This is a rare type of squamous cell cancer that is most often found in the gums and cheeks.
It is a slow-growing cancer that hardly ever spreads to other parts of the body.


OTHER TYPES OF ORAL CAVITY CANCERS
Other types of oral cavity cancers


Minor salivary gland cancers:These can start in the glands in the mouth and throat lining.
Lymphomas:The tonsils and base of the tongue contain immune system (lymphoid) tissue, where cancers called lymphomas can start.
Leukoplakia and erythroplakia:These are possible precancerous conditions where certain types of tissue changes can be seen in the mouth or throat.Did you know?

DIAGNOSIS OF ORAL CANCER
Diagnosis Of Oral Cancer

Diagnosing oral cancer at an early stage is the key to a better prognosis. TNM stands for tumor, node, and metastases. It is one of the staging systems doctors use for mouth cancer. It includes:
PRIMARY TUMOR (T)
Primary tumor (T)
TX:Tumor cannot be assessed
T0:No evidence of primary tumor
Tis:Carcinoma in situ (CIS)- a group of abnormal cells that are found only in the place where they first formed in the body
T1:Tumor 2 cm or less in greatest dimension
T2:Tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension
T3:Tumor more than 4 cm in greatest dimension
T4a:A moderately advanced local disease.
T4b:Very advanced local disease.


REGIONAL LYMPH NODES (N)
Regional lymph nodes (N)
NX:Cannot be assessed
N0:No regional lymph node metastasis ( spread of cancer)
N1: Metastasis in a single lymph node on one side (ipsilateral), 3 cm or less in greatest dimension
N2:Metastasis as specified in:
N2a:Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, more than 3 cm but not more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.
N2b:Metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension
N2c:Metastasis in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.
N3:Metastasis in a lymph node more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.


DISTANT METASTASIS (M)
Distant metastasis (M)
MX:Distant metastasis cannot be assessed
M0:No distant metastasis.

The diagnosis consists of the following:
1. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
1. Physical examination
Primarily, the external parts such as lymph nodes, salivary glands, lips, etc. are inspected
An internal examination of the mouth is performed to look for irregularities, swelling, and thickening.


2. HISTOPATHOLOGICAL EXAMINATION
2. Histopathological examinationVital staining techniques:Tolonium chloride (also known as toluidine blue) staining is used to detect mucosal abnormalities in the oral cavity.

Biopsy:A tissue sample is removed surgically from the suspected region and sent to the pathological laboratory for a detailed microscopic examination.

Brush biopsy:In brush biopsy, cells from the oral lesion are obtained by scraping the surface mucosa.

Exfoliative cytology:Exfoliative cytology is a simple and noninvasive diagnostic technique for the early detection of oral cancer.

Incisional biopsy:In this type of biopsy, a representative tissue sample is carefully chosen for selective diagnosis.


3. IMAGING TECHNIQUES
3. Imaging techniques
Several advanced imaging techniques are used for the diagnosis of oral cancer.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):MRI provides the details of the oral cavity structures and adjacent parts. Soft-tissue discrimination by MRI aids in assessing the extent of local and regional spread of the tumor, invasion depth, and extent of involvement of lymph nodes.

Computed tomography (CT):The CT scan uses X-ray radiation and a computer to create pictures of the body to locate the cancerous lesion and determine its spread to the other parts of the body.

Positron emission tomography (PET):The PET scan determines the spread of tumor cells to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body.

Radiological techniques:X-ray is used to determine the spread of cancer to the other organs outside the mouth and oropharynx. The x-ray done for oral cancer is known as anorthopantomogram (OPG).

Optical imaging techniques:These include optical coherence tomography and tissue fluorescence imaging that can effectively differentiate between cancerous and non-cancerous lesions.

4. BIOMARKER DETECTION
4. Biomarker detection
Biomarkers are used for the early detection of oral cancer. Biomarkers
are components of the cells present in body fluid or tumor cells that are overexpressed during the onset of the disease.


5. OTHER METHODS
5. Other methods
In recent years, significant advancements have been reported in diagnostic techniques that are rapid and specific for the detection of cancer biomarkers. They include:

Raman spectroscopy:It is a safe method used to study materials without damaging them. It gives detailed information about their chemical makeup and structure.

Confocal microscopy:This is another light-based technique that provides images of many important cellular and architectural features of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

TREATMENT OF ORAL CANCER
Treatment Of Oral Cancer


Any kind of cancer requires multidisciplinary treatment that includes surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, alone or in combination. Oral cancer treatment includes:
1. SURGICAL MANAGEMENT
1. Surgical management
Surgery for primary tumors:Surgery is advised for early-stage tumors, while advanced stages require surgery or chemoradiotherapy. Tumor removal methods depend on its location and extent.
Surgery for neck dissection:Neck dissection detects any spread of cancer in the early stage and removes the majority of affected lymph nodes.
Other surgeries:
Glossectomy (partial or total removal of your tongue)
Mandibulectomy (surgery for oral cancer in your jawbone)
Maxillectomy (removal of a part or all of the bony roof of your mouth).


2. SURGERY IN CASE OF RECURRENCE
2. Surgery in case of recurrence
Recurrence rates in the oral cavity are 30%, and Salvage (or 'rescue') surgery is used to refer to surgical treatment after failure of initial treatment.


3. RECONSTRUCTION
3. Reconstruction
The oral cavity is a complex site made up of several structures critical for speech, swallowing, and appearance.
To be deemed successful, reconstruction should attempt to address all three, and it must be tailored to the site of the defect.


4. RADIATION
4. Radiation
Radiation therapy uses X-rays to destroy or damage cancer cells, making them unable to proliferate. Radiotherapy is mainly used in patients with locally advanced oral cancer.

Types of radiation therapy include:External-beam radiation therapy:The most common type of radiation in which the radiation is given from a machine outside the body.

Internal-beam radiation therapy:When radiation treatment is given using implants, it is called internal radiation therapy or brachytherapy. Brachytherapy involves the application of a radioactive source close to the tumor.


5. CHEMOTHERAPY
5. Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy (chemo) is treatment with anti-cancer drugs that are injected into a vein or taken by mouth, which allows them to enter the blood and reach most parts of the body. Drugs used for chemotherapy include:
Cisplatin
Carboplatin
5-fluorouracil(5-FU)
Paclitaxel(Taxol)
Docetaxel(Taxotere)
Hydroxyurea

Other less often-used drugs include:
Methotrexate
Capecitabine

Types of chemotherapy include:Adjuvant chemotherapy:It is given after surgery and is sometimes combined with radiation therapy. The goal is to kill cancer cells that might have been left behind at surgery because of the smaller size and also prevent recurrence.

Neoadjuvant or induction chemotherapy:This is given before surgery with or without radiation to shrink some larger cancers to make surgery easier and remove less tissue..


6. CHEMORADIATION
6. Chemoradiation
Chemoradiation is chemotherapy given at the same time as radiation.
It has been shown to shrink oral cavity and oropharyngeal tumors that are not widespread but are too advanced for surgery.


7. TARGETED THERAPY
7. Targeted therapy
It is the use of medicines that target or are directed at proteins in cancer cells by destroying cancer cells or slowing their growth.
Cetuximabis the most commonly used drug for this therapy.


8. IMMUNOTHERAPY
8. Immunotherapy
This therapy uses medicines to help boost a person’s immune system to find and destroy cancer cells more effectively.
It typically works on specific proteins involved in the immune system to enhance the immune response.

HOME-CARE FOR ORAL CANCER
Home-care For Oral Cancer

There are certain plant-based products used as traditional and domestic medicines and food additives. Some of the herbs with anti-cancer effects include:

Curcumin orTurmeric(Haldi):It suppresses the tumor activity and consequently reduces tumor growth and metastasis.

Ginger(Adrak):It can be used as a therapeutic agent in UV-induced skin diseases, including cancer of lips.

Saffron(Kesar):Studies have reported the antioxidant, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, antidepressant, antihistamine, and memory-enhancer effects of saffron in animal models.

Cinnamon(Dalchini):It has numerous biological functions such as antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammation, anti-diabetes, and anti-tumor activity.


COMPLICATIONS OF ORAL CANCER
Complications Of Oral Cancer

Complications occur either due to untreated disease and subsequent spread of the tumor or commonly due to side effects of treatment. These include:


1. COMPLICATIONS FROM SURGERY
1. Complications from surgeryFailure of the flapDamage to local motor and sensory nervesParalysis of the vocal cordsRestriction of the range of motion of the jawsDifficulty in speakingImproper wound healingPotential long-term requirement of feeding tubesPatients may require an extended stay in intensive care.


2. COMPLICATIONS FROM CHEMO OR RADIOTHERAPY
2. Complications from chemo or radiotherapyPainBleedingOsteoradionecrosisInflammation of the mucosaDry mouth is also known asxerostomiaDifficulty in swallowing and speakingReduced oral intake and malnutritionIncreased infections due to decreased immunity.


ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR ORAL CANCER
Alternative Therapies For Oral Cancer

When considering alternative and complementary treatments for any kind of cancer, it is very important to communicate with your medical teams as some of the alternative therapies may be contraindicated from the treatment plan. An alternative therapy, that has proven beneficial in managing oral cancer is:

PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY (PDT)
Photodynamic therapy (PDT)Photodynamic therapy uses a drug that is activated by light, called a photosensitizer or photosensitizing agent, to kill cancer cells.

Studies suggest PDT, for superficial tumors (2mm)and for tumors with a depth of more than 10 mm, interstitial PDT (iPDT) can be an alternative.

Note:This is just an adjunct to the treatment and does not replace medical treatment.
LIVING WITH ORAL CANCER
Living With Oral Cancer

Living with oral cancer may seem very difficult, but a good support system along with a positive attitude can help the patients cope with the diagnosis and treatment. Some of the things that can prove to be beneficial include:
1. GET ALL THE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT
1. Get all the emotional support
It is normal to feel depressed, anxious, or worried when you get to know that cancer is a part of your life.
Everyone benefits from support, whether from friends, family, religious groups, support groups, or professional counselors.


2. TAKE POST-TREATMENT FOLLOW-UP VERY SERIOUSLY
2. Take post-treatment follow-up very seriously
Patients with oral cancer are at risk for recurrences and cancer in the other parts of the body. Regular dental visits and endoscopies can help detect any early signs.
Endoscopy and other tests are generally done:
- Every 1 to 3 months during the first year
- Every 2 to 6 months during the second year
- Every 4 to 8 months during the 3rd to 5th years
- Every year after the 5th year


3. GIVE IMPORTANCE TO PALLIATIVE CARE
3. Give importance to palliative care
Oral cancer causes severe physical, psychosocial, and spiritual pain to patients and their families.
Palliative care focuses on improving how you feel during treatment by managing symptoms.
Palliative treatments include symptom-relief medication, nutrition, relaxation, emotional and spiritual support, and activities that bring joy.


4. QUIT SMOKING
4. Quit smoking
Smoking is the leading cause of death due to oral cancer.
It is very important to quit smoking because even people with early-stage oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer are at risk of a new smoking-related cancer if they continue to smoke.
