POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION
Postpartum depressionAlso known as Peripartum depression, Perinatal depression, Postnatal depression, and Maternal depression.
OVERVIEW
Overview
Postpartum Depression (PPD) is a serious and common mental health condition that can occur during pregnancy or within the first year after childbirth. While most new mothers experience the "baby blues," a brief period of mood swings, tearfulness,anxiety, and irritability that typically resolves within two weeks. But, did you know?1 in 7 women may develop PPD,which is more intense, longer-lasting, and interferes significantly with daily functioning.


PPD is not limited to mothers alone; fathers and non-birthing partners can also experience postpartum depression. The condition arises from a complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors.


Symptoms of postpartum depression may include persistent sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, irritability, guilt, fatigue, difficulty bonding with the baby, sleep and appetite disturbances, and, in severe cases, thoughts of self-harm or harm to the infant.


Given its impact on both parent and infant health, routine mental health screening during pregnancy and postpartum is critical. Evidence-based treatments, including psychotherapy, especially cognitive behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy, and antidepressant medications, are safe and effective options.

SYMPTOMS OF POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION
Symptoms Of Postpartum Depression

It's common for new mothers to experience a wide range of emotions after childbirth. Many experience what's known as the "baby blues", feelings of sadness, mood swings, tearfulness, irritability,anxiety, and feeling overwhelmed. These symptoms usually begin within 2–3 days after delivery, peak around day 4 or 5, and resolve within two weeks without treatment.

Baby blues symptoms may include:
Doubting one’s ability to be a good parentFeeling pressure to be the “perfect” momA sense of lost identity or reduced self-esteemFeeling less attractive post-deliverySleep disturbances andtirednessLimited time for self-care

However, when emotional distress is severe, persistent, or begins later, it may indicate postpartum depression,  a serious mood disorder that affects10–20%of women after childbirth.

Symptoms of postpartum depression can include:
Depressed moodLoss of interestAgitationAnxietyChanges in sleep patterns orinsomnia(lack of sleep)Change in appetiteFeelings of worthlessness or guiltLoss of energy or fatigueInability to concentrate or indecisivenessRecurrent thoughts of death, which may include thinking about or even planning suicideChange in weight or appetite.Did You Know?
Some women experience postpartum psychosis, a mental health emergency that needs immediate medical attention. This condition disrupts a woman's sense of reality after childbirth. Symptoms may include hallucinations, delusions, mania, and paranoia.
CAUSES OF POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION
Causes Of Postpartum Depression

Postpartum depression is considered a multifactorial disorder, with causes linked to biological, psychological, and social changes that occur during and after childbirth.


One well-established biological factor is the rapid hormonal shift that occurs after delivery. During pregnancy, levels of estrogen and progesterone hormones are significantly elevated. However, within24 to 48 hours postpartum, these hormone levels drop sharply, which may contribute to depressive symptoms in susceptible individuals.


Hormones involved in breastfeeding, particularly oxytocin and prolactin, also play a role. These hormones promote maternal-infant bonding and influence emotional regulation. Disruption in lactation, early weaning, or low oxytocin levels may impair this bonding and increase the risk for PPD.


However, PPD is not caused by hormones alone. Other critical factors may increase the risk, which are discussed in the next segment.

6. OBSTETRIC FACTORS
6. Obstetric factorsComplications during pregnancy like premature birth, being pregnant with multiples, birth defects, and pregnancy loss.Previous miscarriage

7. OVERALL HEALTH STATUS
7. Overall health statusPoor perinatal health, eg,obesityat the time of conception, pregestational or gestational diabetes, antenatal or postnatal hypertension, or infection following deliveryRapid alteration of reproductive or thyroid hormones post-delivery. This makes one feel tired, depressed, agitated, etc.



8. LIFESTYLE CHOICES
8. Lifestyle choicesSmoking or drinking excessive alcoholExtreme sleep deprivationLow sunlight exposure

9. INFANT BONDING AND LACTATION CHALLENGES

DIAGNOSIS OF POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION (PPD)
Diagnosis Of Postpartum Depression (PPD)

There is no one specific test that can definitively diagnose PPD. Therefore, doctors diagnose this condition by gathering comprehensive clinical, medical, family, and mental health history, along with an assessment of lifestyle habits:

1. DISCUSSION OF SYMPTOMS
1. Discussion of symptoms

Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, their duration, and severity. They will inquire about your mood, energy levels, sleeping patterns, appetite, and any thoughts of self-harm or harm to the baby.

2. MEDICAL HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
2. Medical history and physical examination

The doctor will ask questions about symptoms and medical histories, including drug and alcohol history, smoking habits, and all prescription and over-the-counter medications.

They may also request blood tests likethyroid profile,complete blood count (CBC),vitamin B12, andserum iron studiesto rule out other causes of depression.

3. PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT
3. Psychological assessment

TheEdinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)is the most widely used screening tool for PPD.

It consists of10 questions assessing mood over the previous 7 days, including suicidal ideation.

Ascore of ≥10 indicates possible depression, and ≥13 suggests a higher likelihood of requiring clinical evaluationand possible referral.

Note: While EPDS is a validated screening tool, it is not diagnostic. A positive screen should always be followed by a structured clinical interview to confirm diagnosis and assess for other psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety disorders or bipolar depression.
Did you know?
Postpartum depression doesn’t just affect mothers. Studies show that 8–13% of fathers may also experience it. Perinatal mental health issues can impact any parent, regardless of background or income.

Sometimes, mood changes after childbirth can be linked to hormonal imbalances. Check your hormone levels and get clarity with Tata 1mg’s trusted lab tests.

TREATMENT OF POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION
Treatment Of Postpartum Depression

Management of PPD typically involves a stepped-care approach, combining on-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments depending on the severity of symptoms, personal preference, and presence of comorbid conditions.

NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT
Non-pharmacological treatment

Psychotherapy is the recommended first-line treatment for women with mild to moderate postpartum depression, especially those who prefer non-medication approaches or are breastfeeding. These include:




Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT):CBT focuses on identifying and modifying negative thought patterns and behaviors. It helps women develop coping strategies, problem-solving skills, and emotional regulation.

Interpersonal therapy (IPT):IPT is especially effective for PPD. It focuses on resolving interpersonal conflicts, improving communication, and adjusting to new roles and life transitions such as motherhood.

Note: Psychotherapy can be used alone or combined with medication in moderate to severe cases.

PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT
Pharmacological treatment

Used in moderate to severe PPD and psychotherapy alone is ineffective or unavailable. Common antidepressants used are:

Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs):These are the first line of drugs for PPD. Commonly used medications are:CitalopramEscitalopramFluoxetineParoxetineSertraline

Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs): If SSRIs are not effective, then SNRIs are prescribed. These include:DesvenlafaxineDuloxetineVenlafaxine

Other medications:Medicines such as antidepressants, antipsychotic medicines, mood stabilizers, and benzodiazepines to control your signs and symptoms. Examples include, etc.



Bupropion:May be useful in people with fatigue or sexual side effects from SSRIs (not typically first-line)


Benzodiazepines:These are for short-term use for acute anxiety or insomnia. Examples include:DiazepamLorazepam


Antipsychotics or mood stabilizers:Reserved for severe cases or comorbid conditions, such as postpartum psychosis or bipolar depression.

OTHER TREATMENT OPTIONS
Other treatment options

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS):This treatment is an alternative option for women who do not want to take antidepressants while breastfeeding or for those who haven't responded to psychotherapy and antidepressants. A magnetic coil placed on the scalp delivers repetitive magnetic pulses that stimulate specific brain regions, which are underactive in depression.
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT):ECT is a highly effective option for severe, treatment-resistant postpartum depression or postpartum psychosis. During ECT, controlled seizures are induced via brief electrical stimulation under general anesthesia. This leads to neurochemical changes that can quickly relieve severe depressive and psychotic symptoms.
HOME-CARE FOR POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION
Home-care For Postpartum Depression
