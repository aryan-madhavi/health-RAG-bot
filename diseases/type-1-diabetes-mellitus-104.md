TYPE 1 DIABETES MELLITUS
Type 1 Diabetes MellitusAlso known as Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or Juvenile diabetes.
OVERVIEW
Overview

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the body destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leading to a complete lack of insulin. The pancreas plays a vital role in regulating blood sugar by producing insulin, a hormone that helps cells absorb glucose for energy or storage.

Symptoms include frequent urination, excessive thirst, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and blurred vision. It primarily affects children, teens, or young adults, and risk factors include family history, genetic predisposition, and certain environmental triggers.

Managing type 1 diabetes involves daily insulin therapy, monitoring blood sugar, and maintaining a balanced diet with consistent exercise. Education about carbohydrate counting and adjustments in insulin doses based on activity and meals is crucial for effective management.

SYMPTOMS OF TYPE 1 DIABETES
Symptoms Of Type 1 Diabetes

New-onset type 1 diabetes refers to the early stage of type 1 diabetes when symptoms first appear. They include:

Increased thirst (polydipsia)
Frequent urination (polyuria)
Extreme hunger (polyphagia)
Unintentional weight loss, despite eating well
Fatigue and weakness

Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)is a life-threatening condition where the body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones due to insulin deficiency, often occurring in type 1 diabetes if not managed promptly. Symptoms of Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)

High blood sugar with ketones in urine
Electrolyte imbalance leads to metabolic acidosis
Fruity-smelling breath
Severe lethargy or weakness
In extreme cases, coma.
Did you know?
About 50% of adults with type 1 diabetes may initially be diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes. Additionally,type 2 diabetesis rising among adolescents, which accounts for 1–6% of childhood diabetes cases.

CAUSES OF TYPE 1 DIABETES
Causes Of Type 1 Diabetes

Type 1 diabetes is caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking and destroying insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, known as autoimmune destruction. This leads to little or no insulin production, which is essential for regulating blood sugar levels. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) develops in three stages:
STAGE 1 (PRECLINICAL)
Stage 1 (Preclinical)
The autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing β-cells begins, but individuals show no symptoms.
Blood sugar levels remain normal, though at least two pancreatic autoantibodies are detected.
STAGE 2 (DYSGLYCEMIA)
Stage 2 (Dysglycemia)
Significant β-cell damage leads to abnormal blood sugar levels.
Diagnosed by pancreatic autoantibodies along with impaired fasting glucose, glucose tolerance, or elevated HbA1c (5.7%-6.4%). Individuals are still asymptomatic.
STAGE 3 (CLINICAL ONSET)
Stage 3 (Clinical Onset)
Symptoms like high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) appear, signaling the onset of diabetes.

RISK FACTORS FOR TYPE 1 DIABETES
Risk Factors For Type 1 Diabetes

The risk factors for developing Type 1 diabetes (T1D) include:
1. GENETICS
1. Genetics
Certain HLA genes, particularly HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR4, are associated with genetic predisposition
This is linked to increased susceptibility to autoimmune beta-cell destruction.

2. FAMILY HISTORY
2. Family History
Individuals with a sibling or parent with T1D have a higher likelihood of developing the condition.
Although most cases occur without a family history.

Interesting Tibit!
Type 1 diabetes is a genetic condition with a 30–70% chance in identical twins, a 6–7% risk in siblings, and a 1–9% risk for children of diabetic parents.

3. AGE
3. Age
T1D often develops in childhood or adolescence, but it can occur at any age.

4. ENVIRONMENTAL TRIGGERS
4. Environmental Triggers
Viral infections (e.g., enteroviruses, Coxsackievirus, or SARS-CoV-2)

Diagnosis Of Type 1 Diabetes

The right diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes is crucial to prevent life-threatening complications and ensure timely management for better health outcomes. It consists of the following:

1. MEDICAL HISTORY
1. Medical History
Given the increased risk of autoimmune disorders, clinicians should screen for conditions such as thyroid disease and celiac disease.
Psychosocial factors, eating disorders, and cognitive decline should also be assessed.

2. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
2. Physical Examination
A full physical examination, including a diabetes foot exam and inspection of insulin injection sites for lipodystrophy, is critical.

3. LABORATORY TESTS
3. Laboratory Tests

Fasting blood sugar (FBS):It is a blood sugar test performed after at least 8 hours of fasting to measure glucose levels. Readings ≥126 mg/dL on more than one occasion are suggestive of diabetes.
Random blood sugar (RBS):It is a blood sugar test done at any time of the day without fasting. Values ≥200 mg/dL with classic hyperglycemia symptoms are indications for diabetes.
Glucose challenge test (GCT):It measures blood sugar levels before and after drinking a glucose solution to evaluate the body’s ability to process sugar. Blood glucose ≥200 mg/dL, 2 hours after a 75-g glucose load can indicate diabetes.
HbA1C:Also known as glycated hemoglobin, it is a blood test that measures the average level of blood sugar over the past 2 to 3 months. Readings ≥6.5% suggest diabetes.
Islet cell antibodies:Test for autoimmune reactions that target the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, helping diagnose Type 1 diabetes.
GAD total Antibody (Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase Autoantibodies):It is an autoantibody test used to help diagnose type 1 diabetes, particularly in new-onset cases.

Note:Diagnosis confirmation requires two abnormal results of hyperglycemia (increased blood sugar) symptoms are not evident.

4. DISTINGUISHING T1D FROM OTHER DIABETES
4. Distinguishing T1D from Other Diabetes
Pancreatic autoantibodies:Tests check for specific antibodies in the blood that help diagnose type 1 diabetes by identifying immune system markers that attack the pancreas.
C-Peptide levels:It measures how much insulin-producing function is still active in the pancreas, indicating how much insulin the body can still produce.


5. SCREENING FOR AUTOIMMUNE CONDITIONS
5. Screening for Autoimmune Conditions
Conditions such as thyroid disorders, celiac disease, adrenal insufficiency, andrheumatoid arthritisare more common in people with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D).
Screening for these conditions is important when symptoms or clinical signs appear, as they can help in diagnosing T1D and managing associated risks.
