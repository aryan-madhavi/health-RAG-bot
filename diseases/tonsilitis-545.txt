TONSILITIS
TonsilitisAlso known as Inflammation of the tonsils and Amygdalitis
OVERVIEW
Overview

Tonsils are two round, fleshy masses in the back of your throat (pharynx). Tonsillitis is inflammation of the tonsils. It is mostly caused by common viruses, but bacterial infections also can be the cause of infection.

The classic presentation of tonsillitis includes sudden onset of fever and sore throat with inflammation of the tonsils. Children are most commonly affected during their school-going years. Other risk factors include family history, cold weather, diabetes, and air pollution.

The best way to prevent tonsillitis is to wash your hands often, especially before touching your nose or mouth. Also, avoid sharing food, drink, or utensils with someone who is sick.

The management of tonsillitis mainly consists of resting, drinking fluids, and taking medications like painkillers, and antibiotics. In severe or recurrent cases surgical removal of tonsils, called tonsillectomy may be required.

CAUSES OF TONSILLITIS
Causes Of Tonsillitis

Tonsillitis can be caused by both bacteria and viruses. Common bacteria that cause tonsillitis include beta-hemolytic and other streptococci. Though the role of viruses is uncertain, the most common infective agent in causing tonsillitis is the Epstein–Barr virus. It is present in50%of children and90%of adults. Cytomegalovirus is the other virus that can cause tonsillitis.

TYPES OF TONSILLITIS
Types Of Tonsillitis


Tonsillitis can be classified based on its duration of onset as follows:
1. ACUTE TONSILLITIS
1. Acute tonsillitis
This type of tonsillitis is primarily caused by bacterial or viral infections. It presents with swelling and redness on the tonsils, along with fever, cough, and headache. These symptoms usually last 3 or 4 days but can also last up to 2 weeks.
2. SUBACUTE TONSILLITIS
2. Subacute tonsillitis
It is mostly caused by bacterial actinomyces. This type of tonsillitis can last between 3 weeks and 3 months.
3. CHRONIC TONSILLITIS
3. Chronic tonsillitis
This is when you have a long-term tonsil infection. An infection that persists for more than a duration over3 monthsis known as chronic tonsillitis. The virus usually stays and leads to chronic inflammation.
4. RECURRENT TONSILLITIS
4. Recurrent tonsillitis
It is caused by bacterial infections, by streptococcus. Tonsillitis is termed recurrent when there are more than7 episodes in 1 year.

Any infection that recurs more commonly than usual might be because of decreased immunity.

DIAGNOSIS OF TONSILLITIS
Diagnosis Of Tonsillitis


Accurately diagnosing tonsillitis is important to reduce the further spread of infection and to limit complications. Diagnosis includes

1. HISTORY
1. History

A complete history provides important information to determine whether the patient has a sore throat, or whether there is deeper pain in the throat or neck.
2. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

2. Physical examination

Diagnosis of tonsillitis is mainly clinical and it is done by:

Carefully looking in the throat at the infection site with light instrumentsChecking for any rash in the throatObserving ‘toxic’ appearance and signs of dehydrationPalpating neck to check swollen lymph nodesListening to the voice of patientSeeing if there is any enlargement of the spleen (can be a symptom of tonsillitis).

3. LABORATORY TESTS
3. Laboratory tests
Throat swab:This is a simple test in which doctors rub a sterile swab over the back of your throat to get samples of secretions. The samples are later checked in the lab or the clinic.
Rapid antigen test:It may have low sensitivity in the diagnosis of bacterial tonsillitis but, the results for the presence of infection (positive or negative) are very fast.
Complete blood count(CBC):If the strep throat lab test is negative, then CBC is done to determine the cause of tonsillitis. In this test, the number of different cells is counted by taking small amounts of blood samples from patients.

Tonsillitis, if left untreated can lead to complications like;
1. Peritonsillar abscess/quinsy:This is the spread of infection beyond the tonsil that may lead to a collection of pus (abscess) within the space between the tonsils.

2. Airway obstruction:this is a rare complication and requires immediate care, where surgical intervention may be considered an emergency.

3. Post-Streptococcal glomerulonephritis:it is an inflammatory disorder of the kidneys that can manifest 1–2 weeks after a streptococcal throat infection.

4. Rheumatic fever:Rheumatic fever is a rare, but serious, complication of untreated or partially treated tonsillitis caused due to streptococcus bacteria.

5. Scarlet fever:It is an infection caused by group A streptococci bacteria that affects the throat. This is the same bacteria that can cause tonsillitis.What is the difference between COVID-19 and tonsillitis?Sore throat is a common symptom of both tonsillitis and COVID-19.
