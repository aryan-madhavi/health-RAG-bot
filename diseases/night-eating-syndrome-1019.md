NIGHT EATING SYNDROME
Night eating syndrome
OVERVIEW
Overview
Night Eating Syndrome (NES) is an eating disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive eating during the night, often accompanied by insomnia and lack or loss of appetite in the morning, wherein individuals skip breakfast or don't feel hungry. Unlike anorexia nervosa, NES does not revolve around body weight or shape concerns.

NES can disrupt sleep patterns and impact overall health. It may be linked to other illnesses, such as mental health problems, substance abuse, or eating disorders. Additionally, it can coexist with health conditions like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

The exact causes of NES are not fully understood, but a combination of psychological, physiological, and genetic factors might contribute to its development. Left unaddressed, NES can negatively affect one's quality of life, leading to sleep disturbances, weight gain, and emotional distress.

Encouraging individuals with NES to establish structured eating schedules and develop alternative coping mechanisms can be beneficial. Importantly, early intervention and proper treatment hold the promise of significantly improving outcomes and overall quality of life.

SYMPTOMS OF NIGHT EATING SYNDROME
Symptoms Of Night eating syndrome

Common symptoms of night eating syndrome include:

Episodes ofinsomnia:NES can contribute to sleep issues, like difficulty falling or staying asleep. It occurs four or five nights per week.
Disrupted sleep-wake cycle:People with NES may have irregular sleep patterns, waking up multiple times during the night to eat, which can further disrupt their sleep cycle.

Dropped appetite in the morning:Individuals with NES typically report a lack of appetite in the morning and may even skip breakfast altogether. Then, after the evening meal, they may consume more than a quarter of the food they consume throughout the day.
Nocturnal eating:The hallmark symptom is the consumption of large amounts of food after the evening meal, often during nighttime awakenings.  This happens at least twice a week.
Feeling compelled to eat:During midnight awakenings, there is a strong need to eat, which can be difficult to regulate or avoid.
The belief that eating is essential to falling asleep or returning to sleep:This may manifest as waking up in the middle of the night to eat or feeling unable to sleep without consuming something.

Depressionoranxiety:Patients may experience mood changes such as withdrawal, anxiety, or depression. At night, they might feel more depressed.

CAUSES OF NIGHT EATING SYNDROME
Causes Of Night eating syndrome

Night Eating Syndrome (NES) is usually attributed to the following causes:

1. DISRUPTED CIRCADIAN RHYTHM
1. Disrupted circadian rhythm
The body's internal "clock," known as the circadian rhythm, regulates our sleeping and eating patterns. In NES, this coordination between sleep and meal patterns may be compromised, leading to a deeper understanding of the condition.


Individuals, who prefer later sleep and wake times, are more predisposed to NES.


Note:For people genetically predisposed to NES, the impact of stress must be considered. It may trigger low serotonin levels, causing a domino effect that alters the internal body clock and interferes with feelings of fullness.

2. HORMONAL IMBALANCE
2. Hormonal Imbalance
Melatonin and leptin levels (hormones that regulate sleep and hunger, respectively) tend to be lower at night in NES patients, which may contribute to nocturnal awakenings accompanied by food intake.

Other hormones like ghrelin, cortisol, and thyroid-stimulating hormones, which are vital in regulating sleep-wake cycles, hunger, and stress levels, may also be significantly affected in NES patients, underscoring the complexity of the condition.Did you know sometimes your body can confuse thirst with hunger?

Confusing thirst for hunger is common, especially when trying to lose weight. The brain often interprets both signals similarly, causing mixed messages. Eating every three to four hours can help; if you feel hungry between meals, it might be a sign of thirst. Stay hydrated to avoid unnecessary snacking.

RISK FACTORS FOR NIGHT EATING SYNDROME
Risk Factors For Night Eating Syndrome

Some factors that may increase the risk of developing Night Eating Syndrome include:
Genetics:Individuals with a family history of eating disorders or related conditions may have a higher risk of developing NES.

Obesity:People suffering from night eating syndrome may be overweight or obese.

Previous eating disorders:Those with a history of other eating disorders, such as binge eating disorder or bulimia, may be more susceptible to NES.

Stressful life events:NES may be triggered or exacerbated in individuals exposed to high levels of stress or having difficulty coping with stress.

Nicotine dependency:Some studies have suggested a link between nicotine dependence and NES, though the exact mechanisms are not fully understood.

Body image concerns:Negative body image or dissatisfaction with physical appearance may increase the risk of developing NES.

Higher symptom Severity:Individuals with more pronounced NES symptoms may have a higher likelihood of developing the disorder.

Dieting and restrictive eating:Individuals with a history of dieting or engaging in restrictive eating patterns may be at a higher risk of developing NES, as strict dieting can impair hunger control and contribute to nighttime eating habits.

Psychological factors:NES is often associated with emotional and psychological issues, such asstress,anxiety,depression, and low self-esteem. People may use nighttime eating as a way to cope with negative emotions or to find comfort.Did you know?

DIAGNOSIS OF NIGHT EATING SYNDROME
Diagnosis Of Night eating syndrome

Night eating syndrome is a disorder characterized by an abnormal eating pattern, where a person consumes a significant portion of their daily food intake during the nighttime.

To diagnose night eating syndrome, healthcare professionals typically follow these steps:
Medical history:The doctor will take a detailed medical history, including questions about eating patterns, sleep habits, and related symptoms.

Physical examination:A physical exam may be performed to look for any physical indications or symptoms of night eating syndrome or other potential health issues.

Psychological evaluation:A psychological evaluation might be carried out to rule out any underlying mental health conditions that could be contributing to the night-eating syndrome.

Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ):This widely used diagnostic tool for NES assesses six key aspects related to morning hunger, breakfast timing, calories consumed after dinner, sleep difficulties, nighttime awakenings, and episodes of eating during the night. The NEQ helps determine if a person's emotions and behaviors match the characteristics of NES.

Criteria assessment:Specific diagnostic criteria, such as those outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), are used to determine whether an individual meets the criteria for NES.

DSM-5 GUIDELINES
DSM-5 guidelines
The following diagnostic criteria for night eating syndrome are included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5):

Lack of desire to eat breakfast and/or skip breakfast.
Strong desire to eat between dinner and bedtime, as well as during the night.
Insomnia, both difficulty falling asleep and/or maintaining sleep, occurs on four or more nights per week.
A misconception that eating is required to commence or resume sleep.
Frequent feelings of depression and/or worsening of mood in the evening.
What distinguishes NES from other eating disorders?
NES is characterized by nighttime eating with full awareness, while binge eating disorder (BED) involves consuming large quantities of food at one time, and sleep-related eating disorder (SRED) involves eating during sleep without conscious awareness.

It could be very difficult to know the difference between overeating and binging. Get professional help to decode your signs.

PREVENTION OF NIGHT EATING SYNDROME
Prevention Of Night eating syndrome

While prevention of Night Eating Syndrome (NES) may not be entirely within one's control due to genetic and biological factors, there are preventive measures that may help avoid its development:
Maintain a regular eating schedule:Aim to eat regular meals and snacks throughout the day. Avoid skipping meals, as this can lead to increased hunger at night.

Consume a balanced diet:Consume a well-balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrients, such as lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. Avoid excessive consumption of sugary or high-calorie foods, especially in the evening.

Practice mindful eating:Pay attention to your eating patterns and emotional triggers. Learn to distinguish between bodily and emotional hunger. By practising mindful eating, you can develop a healthier connection with food.

Address emotional stress:Identify and address emotional stressors in your life. Learn to cope with stress through exercise, relaxation techniques, journaling, or talking to a therapist or counsellor.

Develop a calming bedtime routine:Formulate a series of relaxing activities before sleep to indicate to your body that it's time to unwind and get ready for rest. Refrain from engaging in stimulating tasks or consuming heavy meals near bedtime.

Avoid stimulants in the late evening:Minimize coffee and alcohol consumption in the late evening, as they can disrupt sleep patterns and contribute to nighttime eating.

Indulge in regular physical activity:Exercise can help improve mood, reduce stress, and regulate appetite. However, avoid intense workouts close to bedtime, which may interfere with sleep.

Reduce nighttime eating:Aim to complete your last meal or snack at least two to three hours before bed. If you experience hunger at night, choose a light and nutritious option, like a small serving of fruit or a handful of nuts.
