RHEUMATIC FEVER
Rheumatic feverAlso known as Acute rheumatic fever, Inflammatory rheumatism, and Rheumatic arthritis
OVERVIEW
Overview

Rheumatic fever, an inflammatory disease impacting the brain, skin, joints, and heart, is a rare complication of untreated group A streptococci bacterial infections. This autoimmune response triggers the immune system to mistakenly target its tissues, causing inflammation in organs like the heart, joints, skin, and central nervous system.

Symptoms include high fever, sore joints, chest pain, and fatigue. While these symptoms often resolve spontaneously, there's a risk of lasting damage to the heart, leading to rheumatic heart disease.

Rheumatic fever risk factors include a recent untreated or poorly treated strep throat infection, especially in children aged 5-15, and living in crowded or low-income conditions where such infections are more common. Repeated strep infections increase the likelihood of developing rheumatic fever.

The primary treatment for rheumatic fever involves antibiotics. Additionally, anti-inflammatory medications or corticosteroids may be prescribed to reduce inflammation and manage symptoms.

SYMPTOMS OF RHEUMATIC FEVER
Symptoms Of Rheumatic Fever

Symptoms usually appear 1 to 5 weeks after a bacterial throat infection and they may vary among individuals. Common symptoms include:
Sore throat
Swollen, red tonsils
Fever
Joint and muscle pain particularly in the knees, and ankles
Chest pain
Shortness of breath
Fatigue
Small painless lumps under the skin
Jerky, uncontrollable body movements (Sydenham chorea) — most often in the hands, feet, and face

In severe cases
Large joints
Heart failure
Behavioral disturbance

KNOW THE DIFFERENCE: SCARLET FEVER VS RHEUMATIC FEVER
Know the difference: Scarlet fever vs Rheumatic fever
Scarlet fever is characterized by a pink, bumpy rash, due to group A streptococci infection in the throat or skin and is usually treated with antibiotics. However, if scarlet fever isn't effectively treated, it might progress into rheumatic fever, a more serious condition.
CAUSES OF RHEUMATIC FEVER
Causes Of Rheumatic Fever

Rheumatic fever can stem from untreated throat or skin infections, mainly caused by group A Streptococcus bacteria, including strep throat, scarlet fever, and impetigo.

The immune system, responding to the bacterial infection, may mistakenly attack healthy tissues, leading to inflammation and potential damage to the heart, joints, skin, and organs. If the antibodies attack your heart, they can cause your heart valves to swell, which can lead to scarring of the valve “doors” (called leaflets or cusps).

Certain risk factors can increase your likelihood of developing rheumatic fever, as discussed in the next section.

RISK FACTORS FOR RHEUMATIC FEVER
Risk Factors For Rheumatic Fever

Rheumatic fever is now relatively rare in developed countries, thanks to the widespread use of antibiotics to treat streptococcal infections. The risk factors for  rheumatic fever include:

1. STREP THROAT INFECTION
1. Strep throat infection
The primary risk factor for rheumatic fever is an untreated or inadequately treated streptococcal throat infection (strep throat). Certain strains of streptococcal bacteria, particularly Group A Streptococcus, are more likely to lead to rheumatic fever.

DIAGNOSIS OF RHEUMATIC FEVER
Diagnosis Of Rheumatic Fever

The revised Jones criteria serve as a guiding framework for rheumatic fever diagnosis, incorporating diverse clinical and laboratory findings. It includes:
REVISED JONES CRITERIA

Revised jones criteria
To make a diagnosis, there must be evidence of recent streptococcal infection (confirmed by throat culture or rapid strep test) along with the presence of two major criteria or one major criterion and two minor criteria. The major and minor criteria include:

Major criteria:
Carditis (inflammation of the heart)
Polyarthritis (inflammation of multiple joints)
Chorea (involuntary movements)
Erythema marginatum (a specific type of skin rash)
Subcutaneous nodules (small, painless nodules under the skin)

Minor criteria:
Fever
Arthralgia (joint pain)
Elevated acute phase reactants (such as elevated CRP or ESR)
Prolonged PR interval on ECG

To make a diagnosis of rheumatic fever, there should be either:

1.Two major criteria, or
2. One major criterion and two minor criteria, along with evidence of recent streptococcal infection.

Other key aspects of the diagnostic process include:
1. CLINICAL EVALUATION
1. Clinical evaluation
Medical history:The doctor will review the patient's medical history, paying attention to recent or past episodes of streptococcal infection, especially strep throat.


Physical examination:A thorough physical examination will be conducted to assess symptoms and look for signs of rheumatic fever.

2. BLOOD TESTS
2. Blood tests
Inflammatory markers:Blood tests likeC-reactive protein (CRP)anderythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are commonly used to detect signs of inflammation in the body. Elevated levels of these markers may indicate ongoing inflammation.

Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer:This blood test measures the level of antibodies (specifically antistreptolysin O) produced in response to a recent streptococcal infection. Elevated levels may suggest a recent or ongoing strep infection.

3. THROAT CULTURES
3. Throat cultures
Throat cultures may be performed to identify the presence of streptococcal bacteria.
However, it's important to note that the bacteria might no longer be present in the throat by the time symptoms of rheumatic fever develop.
This is why antibody tests, like the ASO titer, are often used.

4. IMAGING TESTS
4. Imaging tests
Electrocardiogram(ECG or EKG):It helps identify abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) and can indicate if there is any damage or enlargement of the heart.

Echocardiogram:This test can reveal abnormalities in the heart's structure and function, including inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or damage to the heart valves.

Chest X-rays:These may be conducted to assess the extent of cardiac involvement or to rule out other conditions.Did you know?
Patients who have had rheumatic fever have about a 50% likelihood of having a recurrence if they have another episode of group and untreated streptococcal pharyngitis.

TREATMENT OF RHEUMATIC FEVER
Treatment Of Rheumatic Fever

The treatment of rheumatic fever aims to address the infection, alleviate symptoms, manage inflammation, and prevent recurrence. The following approaches are commonly employed:

1. MEDICATIONS
1. Medications

Antibiotics:These are the first choice to treat streptococcal throat infections. Penicillin is the most commonly used drug. It includes:Penicillin V(Phenoxymethylpenicillin)Penicillin G(Benzylpenicillin)

Anti-inflammatory drugs:Helps to reduce inflammation, fever, and pain. Commonly used medications include:IbuprofenNaproxenAspirin

Note:Do not administer aspirin to a child without specific instructions from a doctor. It is avoided in children due to the risk of Reye's syndrome (it is a rare but serious condition that causes swelling in the liver and brain, often linked to aspirin use in children recovering from viral infections).

Corticosteroids:Prescribed if the patient does not respond to initial anti-inflammatory medications or if there is inflammation of the heart.Prednisoneis most commonly used.

Anti-seizure medications:These medicines are prescribed to manage severe involuntary movements associated with Sydenham chorea. Example include:Valproic AcidCarbamazepineHaloperidolRisperidone


2. LONG-TERM MEDICATION FOR HEART SUPPORT
2. Long-term medication for heart support

Drug options for managing heart failure may include using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (likeLisinoprilandEnalapril) and taking diuretics (likeFurosemideandSpironolactone).

Depending on the severity, heart surgery may be required to repair or replace damaged valves.

COMPLICATIONS OF RHEUMATIC FEVER
Complications Of Rheumatic Fever

Rheumatic fever can lead to several complications, particularly if the initial streptococcal infection is not promptly treated. Some of the complications include:

Rheumatic heart disease (RHD):It is a severe complication that can result in permanent damage to the heart valves, leading to long-term heart problems.

Heart valve damage:Rheumatic fever often targets heart valves, causing inflammation and scarring that may lead to valve stenosis (narrowing) or regurgitation (leaking).

Heart failure:Severe damage to heart valves can eventually lead to heart failure, where the heart is unable to pump blood effectively.

Atrial fibrillation:Irregular heart rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation, can occur due to the impact of rheumatic heart disease on the heart's electrical system.

Pulmonary hypertension:Elevated blood pressure in the main arteries of the heart, is commonly associated with advanced rheumatic heart disease.

Embolic stroke:It can be a complication of rheumatic fever, arising from the migration of blood clots or debris formed due to heart valve damage to the brain's blood vessels.

Jaccoud arthropathy (joint problems):This causes joint deformities due to recurrent bouts of arthritis. It may result in long-term joint damage and deformities due to repeated arthritis episodes.

Subcutaneous skin lesions:Erythema marginatum, a rash with characteristic borders, may appear on the trunk or arms.

Increased susceptibility:Greater vulnerability to recurrent episodes of rheumatic fever if exposed to streptococcal infections.

Sydenham's chorea:A neurological complication characterized by involuntary movements and muscle weakness.


Sudden cardiac death:It is the abrupt, unexpected loss of heart function, typically caused by an electrical disturbance in the heart.
Misconception: Rheumatic fever causesrheumatoid arthritis.
Reality:There's no direct link between rheumatic fever and rheumatoid arthritis. Although they may exhibit similar early symptoms and affect joints in children, rheumatic fever is a short-term condition lasting a few weeks, while rheumatoid arthritis is a lifelong disorder.
