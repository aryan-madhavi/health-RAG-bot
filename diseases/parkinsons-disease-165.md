PARKINSON'S DISEASE
Parkinson's disease
OVERVIEW
Overview
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and slowed movement. Other symptoms may include cognitive impairment, mood changes, and sleep disturbances. PD is caused by the brain's loss of dopamine-producing neurons, leading to neurotransmitter imbalances.

It develops gradually, often starting with a barely noticeable tremor in one hand. Over time, the tremor may spread and become more pronounced.

The exact cause of Parkinson's disease is not fully understood, but both genetic and environmental factors are believed to play a role. Age is the most significant risk factor, with most cases occurring in individuals over 60.

Early diagnosis and appropriate management of symptoms are crucial in improving the quality of life for individuals with Parkinson's disease. Treatment typically involves medication, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications tailored to each individual's needs.

While there is no known way to prevent Parkinson's disease, certain lifestyle factors may help reduce the risk or delay onset. These include regular exercise, maintaining a healthy diet rich in antioxidants, avoiding exposure to environmental toxins, and staying mentally and socially active.

SYMPTOMS OF PARKINSON’S DISEASE
Symptoms Of Parkinson’s Disease

The symptoms of Parkinson's disease usually develop gradually and are mild at first. There are many different symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease, and the severity is different for each individual.


Some of the common symptoms of Parkinson's disease are:
Tremors (Shaking):These usually begin in the hand or arm and are more likely to occur when the limb is relaxed and resting.
Slowness of movement (bradykinesia):The physical movements are much slower than usual, which can make everyday tasks difficult and shuffling walk with tiny steps
Muscle stiffness (rigidity):Stiffness and tension are very common in the muscles, which makes it challenging to move around and make facial expressions and results in painful muscle cramps (dystonia)
Postural instability:Imbalance and changes in posture increase the risk of falls.

PD varies in its progression and symptoms. It often starts on one side of the body before affecting both sides. Some other symptoms range from physical and mental symptoms include:

PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS
Physical symptoms
Loss of sense of smell
Drooling (excessive production of saliva)
Swallowing problems
Speech may become soft or quick with a slur or hesitation before talking.
Excessive sweating
Balancing issues with high rates of falls and injuries.
Writing may become challenging and may appear small.
Blurred vision and dizziness while sitting
Insomniaor sleep disturbances
Rapid eye movement (REM) behaviour disorder and restless legs syndrome.
Constipation
Erectile dysfunctionin men

COGNITIVE AND PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS
Cognitive and psychiatric symptoms
Cognitive issues like memory loss, trouble concentrating, and changes in mood or behavior.
Mental health disorders like anxiety and depression
Dementia – a group of symptoms, including more severe memory problems and  personality changes
What is the difference between Alzheimer's, Dementia, and Parkinson's Dementia?
Let's break it down: Alzheimer's disease is a specific type of Dementia characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline. Dementia, however, is a bigger category, like a puzzle with many pieces, that includes many conditions where thinking and memory are affected. Parkinson's disease primarily involves movement-related symptoms but can also lead to Parkinson's Dementia, where movement problems come with memory issues.


Early detection is crucial for better management and quality of life.

CAUSES OF PARKINSON’S DISEASE
Causes Of Parkinson’s Disease

Parkinson's disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells that produce dopamine, which helps control body movements.

The loss of dopamine-producing cells directly interferes with the signals between the brain and muscles, causing a direct impact on movement coordination and balance.
RISK FACTORS FOR PARKINSON’S DISEASE
Risk Factors For Parkinson’s Disease

The various risk factors for Parkinson's disease include:
AGE
Age
Parkinson's disease usually begins in middle or late life, and the risk increases with age. It usually develops in people greater than 60 years of age or older.

GENDER

Gender
Males appear to have a higher risk of developing Parkinson's disease than females.

HEREDITY
Heredity
Individuals with a family history of Parkinson's disease are at a higher risk. Having a parent or sibling with Parkinson's increases the likelihood of developing the condition.

Having a close relative or parents with Parkinson's disease increases the chances of the disease. However, the risks are still small unless the person has many relatives in the family with Parkinson's disease.

EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN TOXINS
Exposure to certain toxins
Exposure to certain environmental toxins, such as pesticides, herbicides, and industrial pollutants, may increase the risk.

HEAD INJURIES
Head injuries
A history of head injuries, particularly traumatic brain injuries, has been associated with a higher risk of Parkinson's disease.
DIAGNOSIS OF PARKINSON’S DISEASE
Diagnosis Of Parkinson’s Disease

Currently, there isn't a specific test to diagnose Parkinson's disease. An accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's is based on examining the medical history, a review of the symptoms, and a neurological and physical examination.

MEDICAL HISTORY
Medical History
The doctor usually asks the person experiencing symptoms and a family member or friend questions about overall health, family history of Parkinson's disease, past medical problems, and ability to carry out daily activities. The history should include information related to the patient from the person.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Physical examination
A doctor usually notices specific changes in the behavior and personality of the patient. A psychiatric evaluation is crucial to distinguish Parkinson's from other conditions that can mimic it, such as depression, delirium, and mild cognitive impairment.

LABORATORY TESTS
Laboratory tests
There are no lab or blood tests that can help the doctor diagnose whether an individual has Parkinson's. However, specific imaging tests may help the doctor rule out other diseases that could be causing the symptoms.

IMAGING TESTS
Imaging tests
No imaging test is a definitive test for Parkinson's disease. However, the following imaging testa can aid in the diagnosis:

DaTscan:A DaTscan involves injecting a small amount of a radioactive drug, and a machine called a single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanner, similar to an MRI. The drug injected helps in assessing dopamine-containing nerve cells, which are involved in controlling movement.
L-Dopa test:This test involves taking the medicine L-Dopa (Levodopa) to assess whether the symptoms improve. Rapid improvement is a sign of Parkinson's.
In the early stages, it's not easy to differentiate Parkinson's from other similar conditions.Computed tomography (CT)orMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scansare sometimes carried out, especially to rule out other diseases.

Quick Byte!
People often mix up Parkinson's disease with Parkinsonism. Parkinson's disease is a distinct neurological condition where cells in the brain that produce dopamine degenerate. On the other hand, Parkinsonism is a set of symptoms similar to Parkinson's, but it can stem from different causes like medication side effects, or other neurological issues.
PREVENTION OF PARKINSON’S DISEASE
Prevention Of Parkinson’s Disease

There is no certain way to prevent Parkinson’s disease. However, incorporating preventive measures into your lifestyle can potentially reduce the risk or slow down its progression:

The following may have a lower risk of developing the condition:

Incorporate physical activity:Engage in regular exercise, including aerobic, strength training, and balance exercises.

Maintain a healthy diet:Eat a balanced and nutritious diet to support overall brain health.

Drink coffee or tea with caffeine:Consuming caffeinated beverages may reduce the risk of Parkinson's.

Avoid exposure to toxins:Limit contact with environmental toxins and pollutants.

Ensure quality sleep:Prioritize getting enough restful sleep each night.

Manage stress:Adopt stress-reducing techniques such as meditation, yoga, or deep-breathing exercises.

Stay mentally and socially active:Maintain an active social life and engage in stimulating activities like learning new languages, playing musical instruments, and gardening

TREATMENT OF PARKINSON’S DISEASE
Treatment Of Parkinson’s Disease

Currently, there is no cure for Parkinson's disease, but following treatment options are available to help relieve the symptoms and maintain the quality of life.
1. MEDICATIONS
1. Medications1. Oral medications
Levodopa-CarbidopaMost individuals with Parkinson's disease eventually need a medication called levodopa. Levodopa is absorbed by the nerve cells in the brain and turned into the chemical dopamine, which helps control movement.It's usually taken as a tablet or liquid and is often combined with other medications, such as benserazide or carbidopa.The initial dose is usually minimal and is gradually increased until the effect is seen.

Dopamine Agonists:These medications act as a substitute for dopamine in the brain and have a similar but milder effect in comparison with levodopa. They're often taken as a tablet but are also available as a skin patch (rotigotine).
Examples includeapomorphine,pramipexole,ropinirole, and rotigotine.


MAO-B Inhibitors:Drugs likeselegilineandrasagilineblock the enzyme MAO-B, preserving dopamine. They may delay the need for levodopa therapy and enhance its effects.


COMT Inhibitors:Entacapone, opicapone, and tolcapone prevent dopamine breakdown, prolonging levodopa's effects. These medications are usually prescribed for people in later stages of Parkinson's disease.


Amantadine:This antiviral drug can alleviate PD symptoms.


Anticholinergics:Trihexyphenidyl, benztropine, and ethopropazine decrease acetylcholine activity, helping with tremors.
2. Non-Oral medications
When Parkinson's symptoms become difficult to control with oral tablets alone, several other treatments can be considered.Apomorphine:Apomorphine, a dopamine agonist, can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) either by single injection or continuous infusion.

Co-careldopa:For severe Parkinson's, a type of levodopa called co-carbidopa may be pumped continuously into the gut through a tube inserted through the abdominal wall.
