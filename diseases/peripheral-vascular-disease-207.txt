PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE
Peripheral vascular diseaseAlso known as Peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
OVERVIEW
Overview
Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is a condition that affects the blood vessels outside your heart and brain, usually in the legs. It happens when these vessels become narrowed or blocked, often due to plaque buildup (a mix of fat, cholesterol, and other substances). This restricts blood flow, making it harder for oxygen-rich blood to reach your limbs.


People with PVD may feel pain, cramping, or heaviness in the legs, especially during walking or exercise. Other signs include numbness, cold feet, or slow-healing wounds on the legs or feet. Smoking,diabetes,high blood pressure,high cholesterol,obesity, and age over 50 may increase your risk of PVD.


Quitting smoking, eating healthy, staying active, and controlling blood sugar and cholesterol are key to managing PVD. Medications can improve blood flow and reduce symptoms. In severe cases, procedures like angioplasty or bypass surgery may be needed.

SYMPTOMS OF PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE
Symptoms Of Peripheral Vascular Disease

Peripheral vascular disease often develops gradually and may be overlooked. But recognizing its early signs can help prevent serious complications. Common symptoms include:
Leg pain or cramping during activity (claudication)Numbness or weakness in the legsColdness in the lower leg or foot, especially when compared to the other sideSores or ulcers on legs, feet, or toes that heal slowlyShiny skin on the legsHair loss or slower hair growth on the legs and feetWeak or absent pulse in the legs or feetErectile dysfunction, especially in men withdiabetesColor changes in the skin of the legs, such as a bluish or pale tone.


Noticing any of these symptoms? Don’t ignore them. Early diagnosis can make all the difference.

CAUSES OF PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE
Causes Of Peripheral Vascular Disease

In peripheral vascular disease (PVD), fatty plaques narrow or block the arteries in the legs and sometimes the arms. These plaques form due to a buildup of cholesterol, inflammation, and other substances sticking to the artery walls.


As the plaques grow, they restrict blood flow, making it harder for oxygen-rich blood to reach your muscles. When you walk or exercise, your muscles need more blood. But because the arteries are clogged, they can’t keep up with the demand. This leads to leg pain or cramping, also known as claudication.


Over time, your body may try to form small new blood vessels to bypass the blockage. However, these are often not enough, so symptoms persist. In severe cases, wounds on the feet or legs may heal slowly or not at all because of poor circulation.


Rarely, a plaque can rupture or a blood clot can suddenly form, cutting off blood flow completely. This can cause severe pain at rest and is a medical emergency. Several factors can raise your risk of developing PVD, which we’ll explore next.
RISK FACTORS FOR PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE
Risk Factors For Peripheral Vascular Disease

Peripheral vascular disease happens when narrowed or blocked blood vessels reduce blood flow, especially to the legs. Here’s how different factors can contribute to its emergence:


1. NON-MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS
1. Non-modifiable risk factors

Age:People aged 50 years and above often experience natural stiffening and narrowing of the arteries, which can reduce blood flow.

Sex:Men may be at higher risk, though women’s risk rises after menopause.

Family history of vascular disease:Genetics can make you more prone to artery problems, including PVD.

2. LIFESTYLE FACTORS
2. Lifestyle factors

Smoking:Damages blood vessels and lowers oxygen in the blood, increasing your risk of PVD.

Excessive alcohol use:Can raise blood pressure and contribute to vascular inflammation.

Lack of physical activity:Poor circulation worsens with a sedentary lifestyle is a risk factor for PVD.

Unhealthy diet:High-fat or high-sugar diets can raise cholesterol and inflammation, leading to peripheral vascular disease.

3. HEALTH CONDITIONS
3. Health conditions

Diabetes:Damages blood vessel linings over time and can increase the risk of PVD.

Hypertension (high blood pressure):Weakens and narrows arteries, leading to peripheral vascular disease.

High cholesterol:Causes plaque buildup in arteries, which can cause PVD.

Chronic kidney disease:It affects blood flow and vascular health.

HIV infection:It increases the risk of peripheral vascular disease due to chronic inflammation and accelerated atherosclerosis.



Obesity:BMI (body mass index) above 30 increases strain on blood vessels and promotes inflammation.

A comprehensive health check-up can identify narrowed arteries, poor circulation, or underlying risk factors, helping catch peripheral vascular disease early and reduce the risk of complications.

4. BIOMARKERS AND EMERGING RISK FACTORS
4. Biomarkers and emerging risk factors

High CRP (C-reactive protein):A marker of inflammation, linked to a higher risk of arterial disease.

Elevated homocysteine levels:Homocysteine is an amino acid found in the blood, and high levels of it can damage blood vessels and increase the risk of blood clots, which can further cause PVD.



Get tested for CRP, homocysteine, and other key markers to catch vascular issues early.

DIAGNOSIS OF PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE
Diagnosis Of Peripheral Vascular Disease

A stepwise approach helps identify reduced blood flow and the extent of artery involvement. Diagnosis of PVD includes:

1. HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
1. History and physical examination

Detailed medical history:A doctor asks for symptoms like leg pain, lifestyle habits, and risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, and hypertension.

Pulse examination:Assesses the presence and strength of pulses in the legs and feet.

Skin and limb inspection:Checks for signs like shiny skin, hair loss, non-healing wounds, or color changes.

2. TESTS TO DIAGNOSE POOR BLOOD FLOW
2. Tests to diagnose poor blood flow

Ankle-brachial index (ABI):This is a quick, non-invasive test that compares blood pressure in your ankle and arm to check for poor blood flow.

Treadmill ABI test:Evaluates blood flow response to exercise; useful if resting ABI is normal despite symptoms.

Segmental pressure testing:Measures pressure at different levels of the leg to localize any blockage.

Doppler venous ultrasound:It uses sound waves to visualize blood flow and detect areas of narrowing or blockage.

3. BLOOD TESTS
3. Blood tests

Lipid profile:Detects high cholesterol levels, a major risk factor for atherosclerosis (fatty deposits build up inside the arteries).

HbA1c:Assesses long-term blood sugar control in diabetics.

C-reactive protein (CRP):Indicates inflammation linked to vascular disease progression.

Serum homocysteine:High levels can damage vessel walls and promote clot formation.

4. IMAGING TESTS
4. Imaging tests

CT scan Coronary angiography (CTA):Offers 3D images of blood vessels to identify narrowing using contrast dye.

MR angiography (MRA):Uses magnetic fields and contrast to assess blood flow, especially in patients avoiding radiation.

Conventional angiography:This test provides a clear and detailed view of narrowed or blocked arteries, helping doctors accurately locate plaque buildup and guide treatments like stent placement or bypass surgery.

COMPLICATIONS OF PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE
Complications Of Peripheral Vascular Disease

If left untreated, PVD can lead to serious, sometimes life-threatening, health problems affecting the limbs and vital organs. These can include:

Critical limb ischemia:Severe blockage of blood flow to the limbs can cause pain, ulcers, or gangrene, potentially leading to amputation.

Non-healing wounds:Poor circulation delays tissue repair, making even minor cuts or blisters prone to infection.

Infections:Reduced immunity and blood flow increase the risk of cellulitis and deeper skin infections.

Gangrene (tissue death):Prolonged lack of oxygen can cause parts of the foot or leg to die.

Amputation:In advanced cases, surgical removal of toes, feet, or legs may be necessary to prevent the spread of infection.

Heart attackandstroke:Since PVD shares risk factors with atherosclerosis, it raises the risk of cardiovascular events.

Erectile dysfunction(ED):Men with PVD may experience impaired blood flow to the pelvic region, leading to ED.
