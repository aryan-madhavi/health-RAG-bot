HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) INFECTION
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infectionAlso known as Hepatitis B virus infection, Chronic hepatitis B, HBV infection
OVERVIEW
Overview
Hepatitis B is a viral infection that affects the liver and is caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV). It spreads through contact with infected blood or bodily fluids, such as unprotected sex, sharing needles, or from mother to baby during childbirth.



While some people show no symptoms, others may experience fatigue, jaundice (yellowing of skin or eyes), dark urine, abdominal pain, or nausea. Risk factors include unsafe injections, unprotected sex, working in healthcare, and living in areas where HBV is common.


Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent Hepatitis B. It is safe and effective, and it’s recommended for all infants, healthcare workers, and anyone at risk of exposure to infected blood or bodily fluids.


There’s no cure for HBV, but chronic cases can be managed with antiviral medications to slow liver damage. Regular monitoring, a healthy lifestyle, and avoiding alcohol are key. Vaccination is the best way to prevent HBV infection.

SYMPTOMS OF HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) INFECTION
Symptoms Of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Infection

Many people, especially children, may show no symptoms initially. When symptoms do occur, they often appear 1 to 4 months after exposure and can vary from mild to severe. Common symptoms can include:
Fatigue ortirednessLoss of appetiteNauseaAbdominal discomfort or painDark urine and pale-colored stoolsJaundice(yellowing of the skin and eyes)Mildfeverand joint painFlu-like symptoms such as muscle aches

Symptoms in severe or chronic cases:
Persistent fatigue and weaknessSwelling of the abdomen due to fluid buildup (ascites)Easy bruising or bleeding caused by impaired liver functionConfusion or difficulty concentrating (hepatic encephalopathy)Signs of liver failure orliver cirrhosisIncreased risk of liver cancerover time.

Your liver performs over 500 vital functions, including detoxification, digestion, and metabolism. Maintaining liver health is essential for overall well-being.

CAUSES OF HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) INFECTION
Causes Of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Infection

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) mainly attacks the liver cells. The virus gets inside these cells and starts making copies of itself. This process can cause the immune system to react and try to fight the infection, which may lead to inflammation and damage in the liver.

INCUBATION PERIOD
Incubation period
The incubation period of HBV ranges from 30 to 180 daysDuring this period, the virus replicates in the liver, but symptoms may not be evident initially

MODE OF TRANSMISSION
Mode of transmission

HBV spreads through exposure to infectious blood or body fluids. Common modes include:
Perinatal transmission (mother to child during childbirth)Sexual contactSharing of needles or syringesExposure to contaminated medical equipmentLess commonly, through saliva, tears, or sweat, when there is direct blood contact.

RISK FACTORS FOR HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) INFECTION
Risk Factors For Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Infection

Hepatitis B virus spreads through various routes, with certain behaviors and conditions significantly increasing the risk of infection. These include:

Mother-to-child transmission (Perinatal):Babies born to HBV-infected mothers are at high risk, especially without timely vaccination.

Unprotected sexual contact:Having multiple sexual partners or engaging in unprotected sex increases the risk of HBV transmission.

Injection drug use:Sharing needles or syringes exposes individuals to infected blood.

Healthcare exposure:Accidental needle sticks or exposure to contaminated medical instruments can spread the virus.

Household contact:Living with someone who has chronic HBV infection increases risk due to potential exposure to bodily fluids.

Men who have sex with men (MSM):This group is at higher risk due to the increased likelihood of exposure to infected fluids.

Travel or residence in high-endemic areas:Regions such as Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands have higher rates of HBV.

Receiving unscreened blood transfusions:Though rare in countries with stringent screening, this remains a risk in areas with limited blood safety measures.

Age and gender:Older adults and males are at increased risk of HBV infection.
DIAGNOSIS OF HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) INFECTION
Diagnosis Of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Infection

Diagnosing Hepatitis B involves a combination of history, examination, and specific laboratory tests to confirm infection and assess disease activity. It consists of:

1. HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
1. History and physical examination
Your doctor will ask about risk factors such as recent exposure to infected blood, vaccination, and travel history.

A physical exam is done to check for signs of liver disease.

2. SEROLOGICAL MARKERS
2. Serological markers

Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg):Primary marker for acute or chronic infection. Persistent levels beyond six months indicate chronic hepatitis B.

Anti-Hepatitis B Core Antibody (anti-HBc):This is a simple blood test that checks IgM and IgG antibodies and can show whether you have a recent or past hepatitis B infection.

Hepatitis B e Antigen (HBeAg):This is a marker of active hepatitis B virus replication and high infectivity.

Anti-HBe Antibody:This antibody appears after HBeAg clearance, suggesting reduced viral activity and infectivity.

Anti-Hepatitis B Surface Antibody (anti-HBs):It indicates protection against hepatitis B due to vaccination or recovery from past infection.



MOLECULAR TESTING
Molecular testing

HBV DNA test:It checks how much virus is in the blood to understand how active the infection is and how well treatment is working.

Genotyping and resistance testing:Identifies the type of hepatitis B virus and whether it may resist certain medicines.

LIVER FUNCTION AND HISTOLOGY
Liver function and histology

Liver function test:It helps detect liver damage caused by hepatitis B by measuring enzyme and protein levels in your blood.

Non-invasive fibrosis assessment (FibroScan):Evaluates liver stiffness to detect fibrosis or cirrhosis.

Liver biopsy:Occasionally used for detailed tissue analysis when needed.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Special considerations

Occult HBV infection:The virus is present in the body even if the usual surface marker (HBsAg) doesn’t show up in tests.

Immunocompromised people:May need more detailed testing because standard tests might miss the infection.

Amitabh Bachchan contracted Hepatitis B in 1982 after receiving infected blood during treatment for an injury on the set of Coolie. In 2017, he was appointed WHO Goodwill Ambassador for Hepatitis in South-East Asia and has since played a key role in raising awareness and promoting prevention.
PREVENTION OF HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) INFECTION
Prevention Of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Infection

Preventing hepatitis B is crucial, as it can lead to serious liver diseases. The good news is that hepatitis B is highly preventable through a combination of vaccination and safe practices. These include:



1. GET VACCINATED
1. Get vaccinated

The hepatitis B vaccine is over 95% effective and offers long-term protection.
WHO recommends administering the first dose within 24 hours of birth, followed by2–3 additional doses.
Adults aged19–59and those at higher risk should also be vaccinated.



For infants (3-dose schedule):



Birth dose:Within 24 hours of birth
Second dose:At 6 weeks of age
Third dose:At 14 weeks of age

This is often given in combination vaccines like Pentavalent (which includes DTP, Hib, Hep B).

For children and  unvaccinated adults (Standard 3-dose schedule):

First dose:Day 0
Second dose:1 month after the first dose
Third dose:6 months after the first dose



Note: For individuals needing rapid protection, such as travelers, an accelerated Hepatitis B vaccination schedule of 0, 7, and 21 days can be followed, with a booster dose recommended at 12 months to ensure long-term immunity.

Many adults may not realize that staying up to date with vaccinations is essential for preventing serious diseases.

2. PRACTICE SAFE SEX
2. Practice safe sex

Always use condoms and limit the number of sexual partners to reduce the risk of infections.

Using condoms consistently and correctly is one of the most effective ways to prevent sexually transmitted infections, including hepatitis B.

3. AVOID SHARING PERSONAL ITEMS
3. Avoid sharing personal items

Never share needles, syringes, razors, or toothbrushes, as they can carry infected blood.



4. PREVENT MOTHER-TO-CHILD TRANSMISSION
4. Prevent mother-to-child transmission

Pregnant women should be tested for hepatitis B.
If positive, the newborn should receive the hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth.

5. USE POST-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS
5. Use post-exposure prophylaxis

If exposed to hepatitis B, receiving HBIG and starting the vaccine series promptly can prevent infection.

TREATMENT OF HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) INFECTION
Treatment Of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Infection


Treatment for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection aims to suppress viral replication, prevent disease progression, and reduce the risk of liver-related complications. Management strategies differ based on acute or chronic infection. They include:


ACUTE HEPATITIS B
Acute hepatitis B

Supportive care:Most healthy adults with acute HBV infection recover without antiviral therapy. Management focuses on monitoring and symptomatic relief.



Antiviral therapy:Indicated for severe cases showing signs like prolonged jaundice, coagulopathy (blood not clotting properly), or hepatic encephalopathy (confusion or personality changes due to the liver not removing toxins from the blood).

CHRONIC HEPATITIS B (CHB)
Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB)
First-line antiviral agents:These are preferred due to their potent antiviral activity and low resistance rates. Common drugs include:Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)Entecavir

Alternative agents: May be considered in selected patients; however, it has higher side effects and viral resistance. Examples include:Pegylated Interferon-alpha (Peg-IFN-α)LamivudineAdefovirTelbivudine

LIVER TRANSPLANT
Liver transplant

If your liver is severely damaged, a liver transplant might be needed.

In this procedure, the diseased liver is replaced with a healthy one, usually from a deceased donor, though sometimes a living person can donate a portion of their liver.

TREATMENT CONSIDERATIONS
Treatment considerations

Decompensated liver disease:It is a serious stage of chronic liver disease where the liver can no longer perform its vital functions properly due to severe damage. Entecavir is recommended if there's no history of lamivudine resistance; otherwise, tenofovir is preferred.

Pregnancy:Tenofovir is safe and effective in reducing mother-to-child transmission when administered in the third trimester.

HIV coinfection:Requires coordinated treatment to address both HBV andHIV infections, often involving tenofovir-based regimens.

COMPLICATIONS OF HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) INFECTION
Complications Of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Infection

Untreated HBV infection can lead to the following complications:

Chronic hepatitis B:When the infection lasts more than 6 months, it increases the risk of serious liver problems.

Portal hypertension:It is increased blood pressure in the liver’s veins due to scarring, which can cause internal bleeding.

Liver cirrhosis:Long-term liver damage that leads to scarring and poor liver function.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): A type of liver cancer that may develop from chronic HBV infection.

Fulminant liver failure:A rare but life-threatening condition where the liver suddenly fails, requiring urgent liver transplant.

Liver decompensation:When the liver can no longer perform vital functions, causing symptoms like confusion (encephalopathy), swelling (ascites), or bleeding.

Hepatorenal syndrome:A serious condition where kidney function rapidly declines due to severe liver disease.

Hepatic encephalopathy:A buildup of toxins in the brain due to poor liver function, leading to confusion, personality changes, or even coma.

HBV-associated arthritis:A sudden, painful inflammation of one or more joints, often knees, wrists, or fingers, that can occur early in infection but usually resolves quickly without becoming chronic.

Extrahepatic manifestations (less common):HBV can affect other parts of the body and cause:
Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN a rare blood vessel inflammation)
Glomerulonephritis (inflammation in the kidneys)
Vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels).
