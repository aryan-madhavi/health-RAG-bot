VITAMIN C DEFICIENCY
Vitamin C deficiencyAlso known as scurvy, ascorbic acid deficiency and scorbutus
OVERVIEW
Overview
Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that is primarily involved in healing and repairing wounds. Individuals with blood levels of less than 0.2 mg/dL are considered deficient.


Dry, brittle, and coiled hair that hang in a spiral shape, bleeding around hair follicles, and gum bleeding are one of the most characteristic signs of Vitamin C deficiency.


Poor intake of fresh fruits and vegetables, restrictive diets, smoking, pregnancy along with some medical conditions such as Crohn’s disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and eating disorders increases the risk of Vitamin C deficiency.


Daily consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables such as guava, strawberry, papaya, kiwi, spinach, carrots, and bell peppers are the best way to prevent this deficiency. Treatment options include a diet rich in Vitamin C sources along with dietary supplements.

CAUSES OF VITAMIN C DEFICIENCY
Causes Of Vitamin C deficiency

Vitamin C also known as ascorbic acid performs the following functions in the body:
Helps in synthesizing collagen. Collagen is the primary building block of skin, muscles, bones, and connective tissues.
Supports blood vessels through managing structure of collagen
Serves as an antioxidant which helps prevent the deposition of cholesterol in the blood vessels
Aids in absorption of iron in the small intestine

Humans are unable to produce Vitamin C. The deficiency occurs as a result of sustained dietary deficiency for several months. Symptoms start to develop when the total body stores are reduced from 1500 mg to 300 mg.
SYMPTOMS OF VITAMIN C DEFICIENCY
Symptoms Of Vitamin C deficiency

The signs and symptoms of Vitamin C deficiency start to develop 8 to 12 weeks after inadequate intake of Vitamin C.


The major characteristic signs of Vitamin C deficiency are:
Corkscrew hair (dry, brittle, and coiled hair)
Perifollicular hemorrhage (bleeding around hair follicles)
Gingival bleeding (gum bleeding)


The other signs and symptoms include:
Weakness
Fatigue
Poor wound healing
Shortness of breath
Poor appetite
Fever
Anemia
Swelling of gum
Loss of teeth
Mucocutaneous petechiae (pinpoint-sized spots of bleeding under the skin or mucous membranes)
Ecchymosis (discoloration of the skin resulting from bleeding underneath)
Hyperkeratosis (increased thickness of the skin)
Swan-neck hair (bending of hair)
Edema(swelling caused by too much fluid trapped in the body's tissues)
Koilonychia (depression of the central portion of the nails)
Painful hemarthrosis (bleeding into the joint cavity)
Dry eyes
Hair loss
RISK FACTORS FOR VITAMIN C DEFICIENCY
Risk Factors For Vitamin C deficiency

4. EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL INTAKE
4. Excessive alcohol intake
Alcohol increases the excretion of Vitamin C. The excessive consumption of alcohol (>80 g/day) is associated with an increased risk of Vitamin C deficiency.

5. PREGNANCY
5. Pregnancy
Pregnant women are more prone to the deficiency of Vitamin C due to the increase in requirement.


6. HEMODIALYSIS
6. Hemodialysis
Hemodialysis increases the risk of Vitamin C deficiency due to its loss during the procedure. Studies have shown a 50% decrease in Vitamin C after dialysis treatment.


7. LOW SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS
7. Low socioeconomic status
Fresh fruit and vegetables are the major dietary source of vitamin C. Individuals with low socioeconomic status are more likely to develop Vitamin C deficiency due to limited access to these sources.

DIAGNOSIS OF VITAMIN C DEFICIENCY
Diagnosis Of Vitamin C deficiency

The diagnosis of Vitamin C deficiency is made primarily by the evaluation of risk factors. Physical examination is also required in order to evaluate the symptoms and their severity.
In most of the cases, the disease is confirmed with the recovery of supplementation.
I. BLOOD TESTS
I. Blood tests
1. Vitamin C
It includes testing the blood concentration of Vitamin C. A blood concentration below 0.3 mg/dl indicates deficiency. However, this test is not much reliable as it reflects the recent intake rather than body stores.
2. Other nutrients
The other nutritional deficiency can be concomitantly associated with Vitamin C deficiency. The level of other nutrients such asVitamin B12,folate,calcium,zinc, andironare also assessed during Vitamin C deficiency.
3. Leukocyte test
Leukocyte is a type of blood cell which is able to maintain vitamin C concentrations several times higher than blood.  It indicates the long-term dietary intakes of Vitamin C.
A leukocyte vitamin C level of  less than 7 mg/dL indicates deficiency.
II. DERMOSCOPY
II. Dermoscopy
This procedure involves examination of the skin lesions using an instrument called dermatoscope. It helps in evaluating the follicular purpura and corkscrew hairs which are the characteristic feature of Vitamin C deficiency.
III. SKELETAL X-RAY
III. Skeletal X-ray
This is used to confirm the skeletal changes in children as a result of Vitamin C deficiency. Most of the changes are seen at the end of long bones specifically at the knee.
