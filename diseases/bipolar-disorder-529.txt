BIPOLAR DISORDER
Bipolar disorderAlso known as Manic-depression, Bipolar affective disorder, and Bipolar illness.
OVERVIEW
Overview

Bipolar disorder is a mental illness that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, concentration, and the ability to carry out everyday tasks. These moods can range from periods of extremely up, delighted, annoyed, or energized behavior (known as manic episodes) to very down, sad, disinterested, or hopeless periods (known as depressive episodes).

People with bipolar disorder experience periods of unusually intense emotions, changes in sleep patterns and activity levels, and uncharacteristic behaviors. The exact cause of bipolar disorder is not known, but a combination of environment, genetics, altered brain structure, and chemistry may play a role in the development of the disorder.

The most common medicines prescribed by the doctor include mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, and anti-anxiety. Bipolar disorder is a lifelong illness, but long-term, ongoing treatment can help control symptoms and enable you to live a healthy life. You can take care of your condition by making certain lifestyle changes and practicing vigorous exercises like swimming, running, and jogging, which can help with depression and anxiety.

2. BIPOLAR 2
2. Bipolar 2
It is characterized by having both manic and depressive episodes. The mania that occurs in bipolar 2 is less severe than in bipolar 1, hence it is often named hypomania. In bipolar disorder 2 a major depressive episode occurs either before or after a manic attack.

RISK FACTORS FOR BIPOLAR DISORDER
Risk Factors For Bipolar Disorder

Researchers are trying to find the possible risk factors of bipolar disorder. Most of them agree that there is no single cause and it is likely that many factors contribute to a person’s chance of having the illness. Some of the major risk factors include:


1. GENETICS
1. Genetics
Research suggests that bipolar disorder is linked to genetics, as it runs in families. The family members of a person with the disorder have an increased risk of developing it too. A single gene is not responsible for bipolar disorder, instead, a number of genetic and environmental factors act as triggers.

2. CHEMICAL IMBALANCE IN THE BRAIN
2. Chemical imbalance in the brain
The chemical hormones which are responsible for controlling the functioning of the brain are called neurotransmitters and bipolar disorder may be associated with chemical imbalances in the brain.

Note:An episode of mania may occur when levels of noradrenaline( neurotransmitter) are too high, and episodes of depression may occur when the level of noradrenaline becomes too low.

3. TRIGGERING AGENTS
3. Triggering agents
A stressful condition or situation can trigger the symptoms of bipolar disorder. A few examples of stressful triggers include the death of a close family member, the breakdown of a relationship, and physical and emotional abuse.

4. CHILDHOOD TRAUMA
4. Childhood trauma
Studies demonstrate that childhood traumatic events are risk factors for developing bipolar disorders. There is a relationship between the development of bipolar disorder with prior physical, sexual, and emotional abuse.
5. BRAIN STRUCTURE

5. Brain structure
Some studies indicate that the brains of people with bipolar disorder may differ from the brains of people who do not have bipolar disorder or any other mental disorder.

6. SUBSTANCE MISUSE
6. Substance misuse
Bipolar is frequently co-existing with misuse of substances, including cannabis, opioids, cocaine, sedatives, and alcohol.

7. HORMONAL IMBALANCE
7. Hormonal imbalance
Hormones may play a role in the development and severity of bipolar disorder. Studies suggest that late-onset bipolar disorder may be linked with menopause.

8. MEDICAL ILLNESS
8. Medical illness
