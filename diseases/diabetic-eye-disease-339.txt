DIABETIC EYE DISEASE
Diabetic eye diseaseAlso known as Diabetic retinopathy
OVERVIEW
Overview
Diabetic eye disease is a group of eye conditions that can affect people with diabetes, including diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema,cataracts,andglaucoma. Let’s explore diabetic retinopathy and how it affects the eyes.

Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition caused by high blood sugar. It damages the blood vessels in the retina, a thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye that helps you see clearly. Over time, these vessels can leak, swell, or close off, leading to vision problems. It's one of the most common complications ofdiabetes.

In India, around 17% of people with diabetes under 50 are affected by diabetic retinopathy. The risk increases with age and poor blood sugar control. Early stages may have no symptoms, making regular eye checkups essential.

Treatment for diabetic retinopathy depends on its stage—early stages may only require blood sugar control, while advanced stages need more intensive treatments. Options include laser therapy, injections, or surgery to manage vision loss and prevent further damage.

SYMPTOMS OF DIABETIC EYE DISEASE
Symptoms Of Diabetic Eye Disease

In the early stages, diabetic retinopathy often has no symptoms. Changes in the vision can appear as the condition progresses. Possible symptoms may include:
Blurry visionTrouble reading or seeing faraway objectsVision that changes from clear to blurryDark, floating spots or cobweb-like streaksSudden vision loss (in advanced cases)

Diabetic retinopathy is a major complication of diabetes, but keeping blood sugar in check can help prevent it. Get tested regularly—early detection of diabetes can protect your vision and overall health.

CAUSES OF DIABETIC EYE DISEASE
Causes Of Diabetic Eye Disease

High blood sugar from diabetes is the main cause of diabetic retinopathy. Diabetes can damage your eyes' small blood vessels, leading to vision problems.

Some of the extra sugar turns into sorbitol, which builds up in eye cells and causes swelling and damage. Other harmful effects, likestress, can also weaken the blood vessels, making them leak more and grow in abnormal ways.

Special support cells called Müller cells in the eye also stop working properly. They swell and cause fluid buildup, which can lead to blurry vision. Several factors can contribute to these changes, which we’ll explore further in the next section.

DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETIC EYE DISEASE
Diagnosis Of Diabetic Eye Disease

Getting the right diagnosis for diabetic retinopathy (DR) is key to protecting your vision. Understanding the severity helps doctors decide the right treatment. Classification of diabetic retinopathy based on severity:

No DR:Eyes look healthy, no damage seen
Mild DR:Microaneurysms (small bulges in blood vessels) start to appear
Moderate DR:More damage to blood vessels, but not very severe
Severe DR:Significant vessel damage, which includes bleeding, blocked veins, or abnormal vessel growth.
Proliferative DR:New, fragile blood vessels grow and may bleed into the eye, risking loss of vision.



To confirm the diagnosis, the following tests may be used:

EYE TESTS
Eye tests

Basic eye exam:It checks vision, eye pressure, and any diabetes-related changes in the eyes.

Dilated eye exam:This helps doctors see the retina and grade the severity of diabetic retinopathy.

Fundus photography:In this test, pictures of the retina are taken to track changes and help with diagnosis.

Fluorescein angiography (FFA):A dye is used to highlight damaged blood vessels and areas lacking oxygen.

Ultrawide Field Fundus Imaging (UWFI) and Fundus Fluorescein Angiogram (UWFA):This test captures a wide view of the retina to spot early or hidden issues.

Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scan:It is a detailed scan to check for swelling, bleeding, or membrane issues in the retina.

Ultrasonography (B Scan):This test is useful when the view is unclear due to bleeding or cataract.

Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA):It is a non-invasive scan to see blood flow in the retina without using dye.

LAB TESTS
Lab tests

Fasting blood sugar (FBS):Shows if your blood sugar is in the normal, prediabetic, or diabetic range.

HbA1c (glycosylated hemoglobin) test:Reflects average blood sugar over 2–3 months; should stay below 7%.

Note: Tests for kidney, heart, liver, thyroid, blood pressure, and nerves are also required since diabetes affects many organs.

Simple testing, sample collection from home, and timely, accurate results — it’s hassle-free health monitoring. Ready to get started?

TREATMENT OF DIABETIC EYE DISEASE
Treatment Of Diabetic Eye Disease

Diabetic retinopathy treatment research focuses on preventing vision loss by managing blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol, along with specific treatments for the eye. These include:

1. GENERAL MEASURES
1. General measures
Maintain HbA1c below 7%Follow a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise and a balanced diabetes-friendly dietTake your diabetes medicines on timeManage other health issues like high BP, cholesterol, kidney problems, or heart disease with proper treatment and doctor coordination.

2. LASER PHOTOCOAGULATION
2. Laser photocoagulation
This procedure uses laser beams to seal leaking blood vessels and slow the growth of new, abnormal vessels in the retina

Newer laser methods (like Pattern Scan Laser and Targeted Retinal Photocoagulation) aim to reduce side effects and improve accuracy, but more research is needed to confirm their long-term benefits.

3. ANTI-VEGF TREATMENT
3. Anti-VEGF treatment

Medicine is injected directly into the eye to block VEGF, a substance that causes abnormal blood vessel growth. This helps reduce swelling, prevent bleeding, and preserve vision. Common anti-VEGF drugs include:
RanibizumabAflibercept

4. CORTICOSTEROID TREATMENT
4. Corticosteroid treatment

These are anti-inflammatory medicines that help reduce swelling and fluid buildup in the retina. They are often used when anti-VEGF treatments are not effective or suitable. Common corticosteroids used are:
DexamethasoneFluocinolone acetonideTriamcinolone acetonide

5. SURGERY
5. Surgery

Vitrectomy is a surgery used in advanced diabetic eye disease to remove blood from recurrent bleeding or scar tissue pulling on the retina

The jelly-like vitreous is removed and replaced with a clear fluid

It's especially needed when there's retinal detachment or vision-threatening bleeding.

6. NOVEL THERAPIES
6. Novel therapies

Gene therapy:It works by introducing or modifying genes to reduce disease progression with minimal side effects.

Mesenchymal stem cell therapy:These stem cells, especially from bone marrow, may help repair damaged eyes by stopping abnormal blood vessel growth and encouraging healthy tissue to grow back

SGLT2 inhibitors:Drugs likedapagliflozinmay help prevent DR by protecting retinal blood vessels and reducing glucose-related vascular damage. But they are still under research.

Islet cell transplantation:Transplanting insulin-producing cells helps control blood sugar may slow or prevent DR progression. Though more robust trials are needed for this therapy.

COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETIC EYE DISEASE
Complications Of Diabetic Eye Disease

Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to diabetic retinopathy, which can further lead to the following complications:

Vitreous hemorrhage:Bleeding into the gel-like substance inside the eye can cause sudden vision loss and floaters. In severe cases, the hemorrhage can completely block vision.

Retinal detachment:Scar tissue from diabetic retinopathy can pull the retina away from the back of the eye, threatening vision.

Macular edema:It is the buildup of fluid in the central part of the retina (macula), leading to blurred or distorted vision.

Neovascular glaucoma:New abnormal blood vessels block fluid drainage, raising eye pressure

Severe vision loss or blindness:Advanced stages can lead to permanent loss of eyesight.

The best way to avoid these complications is through effective diabetes management. Hear from our experts on how to take control of your health.
