TYPES OF THROAT CANCER
Types of Throat Cancer

Throat cancer can be categorized based on the part of the throat affected, i.e pharynx (that includes the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx) or the larynx:

1. Nasopharyngeal:This type of cancer occurs in the nasopharynx, the upper part of the throat behind the nose.

2. Oropharyngeal cancer:This cancer affects the oropharynx, which includes the base of the tongue, tonsils, soft palate, and the walls of the pharynx.

3. Hypopharyngeal cancer:This rare type of cancer originates in the hypopharynx, the lower part of the throat that surrounds the larynx and esophagus (the muscular tube connecting the throat to the stomach).

4. Laryngeal cancer:Laryngeal cancer develops in the larynx, commonly known as the voice box.

CAUSES OF THROAT CANCER
Causes Of Throat Cancer

The cause of throat cancer is generally attributed to genetic mutations in the cells of the throat, which lead to uncontrolled cell growth and the formation of tumors.

Here's an overview of the processes involved in cancer:

DNA, the hereditary material, controls the behaviour, growth, division, and death of cells.
Certain genes regulate the timing of cell growth, division, and death, such as:
Oncogenes promote cell growth, division, and survival.
Tumor suppressor genes control cell division and initiate cell death when necessary.

Throat cancer can result from DNA mutations that activate oncogenes or deactivate tumor suppressor genes, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and abnormal mass formation in the throat.
CANCER HAS A DUAL CONNECTION WITH OUR GENES

Cancer has a dual connection with our genes
Firstly, there are inherited gene mutations that are transmitted through families. Secondly, acquired gene mutations develop over an individual's lifetime.
RISK FACTORS FOR THROAT CANCER

DIAGNOSIS OF THROAT CANCER
Diagnosis Of Throat Cancer

The diagnosis of throat cancer involves a comprehensive approach, including:
1. MEDICAL HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
1. Medical history and physical examination
The doctor will begin by taking a detailed medical history, including information about symptoms, risk factors, and any relevant family history.
A thorough physical examination of the throat, neck, and surrounding areas will be conducted to identify any abnormalities, such as lumps or changes in tissue.

2. IMAGING STUDIES
2. Imaging studies
Imaging tests help determine the extent of the cancer and whether it has spread to other areas. Common imaging studies include:

CT scan(Computed tomography):Provides detailed cross-sectional images of the throat and surrounding structures.

MRI (Magnetic resonance Imaging):Produces detailed images that can help evaluate the extent of tumor involvement.


PET-CT scan(Positron Emission Tomography with Computed Tomography):Helps identify areas with increased metabolic activity, indicating possible cancer spread.


Barium swallow:It involves swallowing a contrast material containing barium to visualize the upper gastrointestinal tract during X-rays. It can reveal abnormalities in various throat regions, often identifying small, early-stage tumors.

X-ray:Conducting an X-ray of the chest helps assess potential lung metastasis. Lung involvement typically indicates advanced cancer.


Bone scan:A low-dose radioactive material is injected to detect cancer-related bone damage. This scan helps check if cancer has spread to the bones.

3. BIOPSY
3. Biopsy
Tissue samples obtained during endoscopy or other procedures are sent to a pathologist for examination. There are three main types:
Endoscopic biopsy:A lighted instrument called an endoscope is used to visualize and sample abnormal areas in the throat.

Incisional biopsy:Small tissue pieces are cut from abnormal areas, often requiring surgery in an operating room with general anesthesia.

Fine needle aspiration (FNA cytology):A thin needle is used to extract cells from tumors or lumps.



4. ENDOSCOPY
4. Endoscopy
This involves the use of a flexible tube with a light and camera (endoscope) to examine the inside of the throat.

TREATMENT OF THROAT CANCER
Treatment Of Throat Cancer

The treatment of throat cancer depends on various factors, including the type and stage of the cancer, as well as the patient's overall health. Here is an overview of the common treatment modalities:


1. SURGERY
1. Surgery
If the tumor is of significant size, surgery might be advised for its removal. The specific surgical approach will be determined by the cancer's location. Various surgical approaches include:
Laser surgery:Early-stage tumors may be treated with laser surgery, a minimally invasive procedure that uses a laser beam to remove or vaporize cancerous tissue.

Cordectomy:Part or all of the vocal cords are removed, suitable for small or surface-level glottic cancers. Speech changes may occur, ranging from hoarseness with partial removal to the loss of speech if both vocal cords are removed.

Minimally invasive or endoscopic surgery:It involves the removal of entire tumors through the mouth, eliminating the need for external incisions and minimizing impacts on speech and swallowing functions.

Vocal cord stripping:When cancer or pre-cancer is limited to the surface of the vocal cords, this surgical procedure removes the cancer and superficial layers of tissue. After this operation, most individuals can regain normal speech.

Partial laryngectomy:In cases where the cancer is confined to a specific part of the larynx, a portion of the larynx may be removed while preserving vocal function.

Total laryngectomy:In advanced cases, the entire larynx may need to be removed, necessitating lifestyle adjustments and potentially impacting speech and breathing. Reconstructive surgery may be performed to restore some functions.


2. CHEMOTHERAPY
2. Chemotherapy
Following throat cancer surgery, chemotherapy may be employed to eradicate any remaining tumor cells. It involves the administration of drugs that circulate throughout the body, targeting and eliminating cancer cells.
Often, it is combined with radiation therapy in a treatment approach known as chemoradiation, aiming to enhance overall effectiveness.

Drugs used for chemotherapy include:CarboplatinPaclitaxelOxaliplatinCapecitabineDocetaxelCisplatin5-fluorouracil (5-FU)


3. RADIATION THERAPY
3. Radiation therapyExternal beam radiation:High-energy beams are directed at the cancer from outside the body to destroy cancer cells. This can be the primary treatment or used post-surgery to eliminate residual cancer cells.

Internal beam radiation (Brachytherapy):Radioactive sources are placed directly into or near the tumor, delivering targeted radiation. It is often used in combination with external beam radiation.


4. TARGETED THERAPY
4. Targeted therapy
In this therapy, targeted drugs may be used in combination with radiation therapy or chemotherapy for certain cases of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers.
It targets specific molecules involved in cancer growth.
Cetuximabis the most commonly used drug.


5. IMMUNOTHERAPY
5. Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy enhances the body's immune system, enabling it to identify and eliminate cancer cells.
Drugs used are:
Pembrolizumab
Nivolumab

6. PROTON THERAPY

6. Proton therapy
It involves using proton beams to precisely target tumors, minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue.
It offers a more targeted and potentially less damaging radiation treatment option compared to traditional radiation therapies.
COMPLICATIONS OF THROAT CANCER
Complications Of Throat Cancer

Throat cancer, like any form of cancer, can lead to various complications, depending on factors such as the stage of cancer, its location, and the chosen treatment. Some common complications associated with throat cancer include:

Voice changes:This can range from hoarseness to a complete loss of voice depending on the location of the cancer, particularly if the larynx (voice box) is affected.

Difficulty swallowing or speaking:Throat cancer, depending on its stage and location, can impair the normal function of the throat and vocal cords.

Malnutrition:Difficulty swallowing and changes in taste can contribute to malnutrition.

Infections:Weakened immune defenses from cancer treatments can make patients more susceptible to infections, including respiratory and oral infections.

Airway obstruction:It may occur due to the tumor's growth, leading to breathing difficulties and potentially necessitating interventions like a tracheostomy to maintain an open airway.

Oral mucositis:It is inflammation and ulceration of the mucous membranes lining the oral cavity. It is a common side effect of radiation therapy and chemotherapy.

Tissue fibrosis:It is the scarring of healthy tissues in the throat that can result from radiation therapy leading to reduced flexibility, impaired function, and complicating swallowing and speaking.

Reduced salivation:This is reduced saliva production, often due to radiation therapy, which can lead to dry mouth increasing the risk of dental issues.

Disfigurement:Surgical procedures, radiation, and the progression of the disease itself can result in changes to facial appearance, causing emotional distress and impacting a patient's self-esteem.Did you know?
