GENITAL WARTS
Genital wartsAlso known as Condyloma acuminata and Venereal warts
OVERVIEW
Overview
Genital warts are soft, skin-colored growths that appear on or around the genital and anal areas. They are generally caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), specifically low-risk types like HPV 6 and 11. These warts are a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) and can affect both men and women.


Symptoms may include small, flesh-colored bumps that may appear singly or in clusters. Some people may also experienceitching, discomfort, or bleeding, though many have no symptoms at all. Unprotected sex, multiple sexual partners, weakened immunity, and early age of sexual activity can increase the risk of genital warts.


Treatment options include topical medications, cryotherapy (freezing), laser removal, or surgical excision. While genital warts are not cancerous, having an HPV infection can increase the risk of cervical and other cancers. HPV vaccination can help prevent infection.

SYMPTOMS OF GENITAL WARTS
Symptoms Of Genital Warts

Genital warts may not always cause symptoms, but they can cause discomfort. Here are common symptoms:


Small, flesh-colored or gray bumps on the genital or anal area
Warts may appear alone or in clusters (like a cauliflower shape)
Itching, irritation, or discomfort in the affected area
Mild pain, especially during sex or while passing urine
Occasional bleeding from the warts
Moist texture or soft feel on the surface of the warts.
CAUSES OF GENITAL WARTS
Causes Of Genital Warts

Genital warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), most commonly types 6 and 11.
The virus spreads through skin-to-skin contact, often during sexual activity, and enters the body through tiny cuts or breaks in the skin.
Once inside, it settles in the lower layers of the skin and causes the infected cells to grow faster than usual, leading to the formation of soft, flesh-colored bumps known as warts.
After infection, the virus usually stays in the body without symptoms for a while.
The incubation period can range from 3 weeks to 8 months, but on average, warts appear about 2 to 3 months after contact.
Even without visible warts, a person can still carry and pass on the virus.

Did You Know?
HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection worldwide. But here’s the good news: the types that cause genital warts are considered low-risk. Still, protecting yourself through vaccination is one of the smartest steps you can take.

RISK FACTORS FOR GENITAL WARTS
Risk Factors For Genital Warts

HPV is the main cause of genital warts, and it spreads easily through skin-to-skin contact. Certain factors can make infection more likely, including:


Multiple sexual partners:More partners can increase the risk of HPV exposure, leading to genital warts.
Early sexual activity:Starting sex at a young age increases long-term exposure risk.
Unprotected sex:Skipping condoms allows HPV to spread through direct skin contact.
Young age:HPV infection and genital warts are most common in this age group, especially 20–30 years.
Smoking:It weakens the immune response, making it harder to fight off HPV, which can increase the risk of genital warts.
Weakened immunity:A low immune response in conditions likeHIV infection, organ transplant, etc, raises the risk of persistent HPV infection.
Existing STIs:Other sexually transmitted infections make it easier for HPV to enter the body.
Partner with a history of genital warts:You can still be exposed even if they don’t have visible warts.
Low socioeconomic status:Associated with less access to healthcare, screening, and vaccination.
Long-term use of oral contraceptives:This slightly increases the risk of HPV persistence in some women.
Having given birth multiple times:It may raise HPV persistence risk due to cervical changes during pregnancy.

DIAGNOSIS OF GENITAL WARTS
Diagnosis Of Genital Warts

Genital warts are usually diagnosed through a physical exam, but in some cases, additional tests may be used to rule out other issues or check for related risks. Diagnosis includes:


Visual examination:Doctors typically diagnose genital warts by looking for soft, flesh-colored growths on the genital or anal area.
Dermoscopy:It is a non-invasive skin examination technique that uses a magnifying lens and light to view skin structures. It may help differentiate warts from other skin conditions.
Pap smear(for women):While not used to diagnose genital warts directly, a Pap test may be done to screen for abnormal cervical changes caused by high-risk HPV strains.
HPV DNA testing:This test detects high-risk HPV types linked to cancer (not the low-risk types that cause warts) but may be recommended alongside a Pap smear for cervical cancer screening.
Biopsy (if needed):A tissue sample may be taken if the wart looks unusual, is resistant to treatment, or to rule out cancer.


Getting tested is now simpler than ever with the convenience of home sample collection and the assurance of timely, accurate results from Tata 1mg.

TREATMENT OF GENITAL WARTS
Treatment Of Genital Warts

While genital warts may go away on their own, treatment can help remove them faster, ease discomfort, and reduce the risk of spreading the virus. It includes:
1. TOPICAL TREATMENTS
1. Topical treatments
These are prescription creams, gels, or solutions applied directly to the wart-affected area. They work by either destroying the wart tissue or helping the immune system fight the virus over time. Some examples include:
Imiquimod
Podophyllotoxin


2. IN-CLINIC PROCEDURES
2. In-clinic procedures
Doctors may recommend these if warts are large, stubborn, or keep coming back:
Cryotherapy:This involves applying liquid nitrogen to the wart, which freezes and destroys the affected tissue. It may cause mild stinging or blistering and usually needs a few sessions for full removal.
Electrocautery:The wart is burned off using a small electrical current through a heated probe. It’s usually done under local anesthesia and is effective for not-so-large, stubborn warts.
Laser therapy:A focused beam of light is used to vaporize wart tissue, especially useful for large or hard-to-reach warts. This is typically reserved for cases that don’t respond to other treatments.
Surgical removal:Warts are cut out using a scalpel in a minor surgical procedure. It offers immediate results and is often used when other methods have failed or when rapid removal is needed.
