MYOCARDITIS
MyocarditisAlso known as Inflammatory cardiomyopathy, Idiopathic myocarditis, and Viral cardiomyopathy
OVERVIEW
Overview
Myocarditis is a medical condition in which the myocardium, a heart muscle, gets inflamed. It is a rare cardiovascular disease that enlarges the heart, degenerates the heart muscle cells, and develops scar tissues. These factors force the heart to work harder to supply blood and oxygen all over the body. Some of the common symptoms of myocarditis include chest pain, irregular or rapid heartbeat, difficulty breathing, accumulation of fluid with swelling in lower extremities,fever,fatigue, etc.

Myocarditis is likely to affect anyone, regardless of age. Various possible agents like viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, autoimmune responses, and certain medications can trigger this condition.

Myocarditis can resolve on its own without treatment. Treating the underlying cause, such as using antibiotics for bacterial infections, can ensure full recovery. Specific medications or hospitalization may be required to effectively manage severe or prolonged cases.

SYMPTOMS OF MYOCARDITIS
Symptoms Of Myocarditis

People with myocarditis may not show any noticeable symptoms initially. Some of the common symptoms may include:

SYMPTOMS IN ADULTS
Symptoms in adults
Chest pain or discomfort
Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
Edema(swelling in ankles, legs, or feet)
Palpitations or abnormal heartbeat
Infection-related fever
Flu-like symptoms (sore throat,headache,body aches,joint pain)


SYMPTOMS IN CHILDREN OR INFANTS
Symptoms in children or infants
Poor appetite
Stomach ache
Weakness
Chroniccough
Rashes
Fever
Diarrhea
Sore throat
Difficulty breathing
Joint painDid you know?
Severe COVID-19 can cause new-onset heart failure even without prior cardiovascular disease. Symptoms like cough, fever, difficulty breathing, chest pain, and palpitations may result from COVID-19 itself, leading to a silent presentation of COVID-19 myocarditis.

CAUSES OF MYOCARDITIS
Causes Of Myocarditis


Myocarditis is a rare health condition. The causes are discussed below:
1. VIRUSES

2. Bacterias
The bacteria that may cause inflammation of the myocardium include corynebacterium, meningococci, streptococci, clostridia, etc.

3. FUNGI
3. Fungi
Although rare, fungal myocarditis can occur due to infections caused by various fungi including candida, aspergillus, and histoplasma.

4. PARASITES
4. Parasites
Certain parasites, such as Trypanosoma cruzi, Toxoplasma, and Trichinella, can cause myocarditis, with Chagas' disease being the most significant parasitic heart infection.

DIAGNOSIS OF MYOCARDITIS
Diagnosis Of Myocarditis

After a physical checkup and evaluation of medical history, the doctor may recommend the following tests to confirm the diagnosis:
1. BLOOD TESTS
1. Blood tests
Creatine kinase(CK):It is a blood test that checks the level of CK in the blood. If it is more than the normal range, it might indicate an infection in the myocardium.

Total leukocyte count:Abnormal WBC (white blood cells) count can help diagnose myocarditis due to infections.

CRP:Increased levels of CRP (C-reactive protein) act as an inflammatory marker which can suggest myocarditis.

ESR:Elevated ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation rate) is also another marker for inflammation in the body.

Troponin levels:Increased level of troponin (circulating) in the blood can indicate damage to the heart muscle.

2. IMAGING TESTS
2. Imaging tests
Electrocardiography:Electrocardiogram is performed to detect the electrical activity of the heart.

Chest X-ray:A chest X-ray may help to check for enlargement of the heart or accumulation of fluid in the heart's sac.

Echocardiography:It uses high-pitched sound waves to produce a picture of your heart. It also helps with blood flow analysis and analysis of any valve problems, heart enlargement, and the presence of a clot within or around the heart.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):A cardiac MRI uses radio waves and a magnetic field to show the size, and shape, as well as swelling, inflammation, or scarring of the heart.

3. BIOPSY
3. Biopsy
Cardiac catheterization involves threading a tiny tube into the heart to measure or biopsy for inflammation or infection.
Biopsy is not routinely performed and is suggested in special cases of:
Severe arrhythmia
Conventional supportive therapy that did not work
Suspected acute dilated cardiomyopathy (A heart condition that is caused due to blockage in the coronary arteries).


4. MICRO-RNA PROFILING
4. Micro-RNA profiling
It checks small RNA molecules in tissues or blood to understand how genes are controlled.
This test is done to detect acute and chronic myocarditis or the severity of myocardial damage.

TREATMENT OF MYOCARDITIS
Treatment Of Myocarditis

Treatment options for myocarditis vary based on the underlying cause and the severity of the condition. The following approaches are commonly used to manage myocarditis:

1. ANTIBIOTICS
1. Antibiotics
If myocarditis is due to an underlying cause, like a bacterial infection, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics. Some commonly used drugs are:AmoxycillinDoxycycline


2. CORTICOSTEROIDS
2. Corticosteroids
Autoimmune conditions like lupus can cause myocarditis, and in such cases, doctors may prescribe corticosteroids to reduce the immune response, such as:CiclosporinPrednisolone


3. MEDICATIONS FOR HEART FAILURE
3. Medications for heart failure
The doctor is likely to prescribe diuretics, beta-blockers, and ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme)-inhibitors to minimize edema and the workload on the heart. These may include the following:Enalapril(ACE inhibitor)Lisinopril(ACE inhibitor)Metoprolol succinate(Beta-blocker)Furosemide(Diuretic)Captopril(ACE inhibitor)Ramipril(ACE inhibitor)Carvedilol(Beta-blocker)


4. ANTIVIRAL DRUGS
4. Antiviral drugs
Antiviral therapy withribavirinor interferons in viral myocarditis can help reduce the severity of the disease, and decrease mortality.

If the symptoms are severe and medications are not working the way they should, more proactive treatment options might be tried. These include the following:

IVIG (Intravenous immunoglobulin):is a treatment that helps control inflammation and immune responses by providing antibodies.

VAD (Ventricular assist device):It is a mechanical device that is used to pump an adequate amount of blood from the ventricles (lower chambers) of the heart to the other parts of the body.

Intra-aortic balloon pump:Also known as IABP, it is a therapeutic device that allows the heart to pump more blood and reduce its load.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO):ECMO is a respiratory or cardiac support machine that allows the lungs and heart to function normally.

Heart transplant:In case of severe conditions and if the other myocarditis treatment did not work, the doctor is likely to suggest heart transplantation surgery.

COMPLICATIONS OF MYOCARDITIS
Complications Of Myocarditis

Timely treatment of myocarditis has a good prognosis without having any long-term complications. However, severe cases may have some permanent complications related to heart muscles. These include the following:

Heart failure:Myocarditis, if left untreated, is likely to damage the heart muscles, making it inefficient to work properly. It may also lead to heart failure.

Strokeorheart attack:If the heart is unable to pump an adequate amount of blood, there is a risk of blood clot formation in the heart. If a blood clot creates a blockage in an artery of the heart, one may suffer a heart attack. Also, if the clot travels to the brain it can cause a stroke.

Arrhythmia:When the heart muscles are injured or become weak, it may lead to arrhythmia or irregular heart rhythm.

Ventricular dysrhythmias:These are abnormal heart rhythms that make the lower chambers of the heart twitch instead of pump. This can limit or stop the heart from supplying blood to the body.

Left ventricular aneurysm:It forms when a section of the heart muscle in the left ventricle (the chamber of the heart that pumps blood to the body) stretches and becomes very thin.

Dilated cardiomyopathy:It is a type of heart muscle disease that causes the heart chambers (ventricles) to thin and stretch, growing larger.

Cardiogenic shock:This is a life-threatening condition in which your heart suddenly can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.

Sudden cardiac death or SCD:It is a life-threatening complication in which the heart may stop beating due to severe arrhythmia.
