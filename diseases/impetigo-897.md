IMPETIGO
ImpetigoAlso known as Pyoderma, Impetigo contagiosa, and School sores
OVERVIEW
Overview

Impetigo is a contagious skin infection that mostly affects kids but adults can get it too. It is caused by bacteria, typically Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, entering through breaks in the skin like cuts, scratches, or insect bites.

While it can occur anywhere on the body, it often targets the face, hands, and feet. The main symptoms of impetigo are red sores or blisters that burst and form a honey-colored crust on the skin. Risk factors include
poor hygiene, crowded living conditions, and skin injuries, with children being more susceptible.

Treatment involves topical or oral antibiotics to eradicate the bacteria, along with proper hygiene practices. Although impetigo is usually a self-limiting condition, prompt intervention is essential to prevent its spread.

TYPES OF IMPETIGO
Types of Impetigo

There are three main types of impetigo, each caused by different bacteria. They include:
1. NON-BULLOUS IMPETIGO (CRUSTED)

1. Non-bullous impetigo (crusted)
This prevalent type, responsible for 70% of cases, is primarily caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria.
Typically starting around the nose and face, it may also affect the arms and legs.

2. BULLOUS IMPETIGO (LARGE BLISTERS)
2. Bullous impetigo (large blisters)
Constituting 30% of cases, this variant results from Staphylococcus aureus bacteria producing a toxin, forming larger, clear fluid-filled blisters or bullae.

Note:Both types typically resolve within two to three weeks without scarring, with rare complications such as post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.
3. ECTHYMA (ULCERS)

3. Ecthyma (ulcers)
A severe form extending deeper into skin layers, caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes.
The presence of painful, ulcerative sores that penetrate deeper skin layers, leading to scarring upon healing.
CAUSES OF IMPETIGO
Causes Of Impetigo


Impetigo arises when bacteria, specifically group A Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus, enter the body through skin breaks like cuts or scratches.
Subsequently, these bacteria multiply, causing an infection in the affected area.
Characteristic symptoms, such as red sores, blisters, and skin lesions, emerge approximately 10 days after exposure to group A strep bacteria.
The infection, highly contagious, spreads through direct contact or touching contaminated items.

There are two ways an initial infection can occur:

1. Primary impetigo:It is when the bacteria invades the skin through a cut, insect bite or other injury.

2. Secondary impetigo:It is where the bacteria invade the skin due to a disrupted skin barrier from another skin infection likeeczemaor scabies.

Impetigo is generally confused with eczema!
Impetigo is a contagious bacterial infection causing sores and crusts, while eczema is a non-infectious, chronic skin condition causing dry, itchy, and inflamed skin.

DIAGNOSIS OF IMPETIGO
Diagnosis Of Impetigo

Diagnosing impetigo is typically based on the following:

1. HISTORY AND CLINICAL EXAMINATION
1. History and clinical examination
A thorough history and physical exam are essential to spot key features of impetigo, like small blisters and honey-colored crusts.
The doctor will ask about medical history, recent skin injuries, and potential exposure to others with impetigo for a clinical diagnosis.

2. CULTURE AND SENSITIVITY TESTING FOR CONFIRMATION
2. Culture and sensitivity testing for confirmation
In cases of recurrent, widespread, or suspected methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, a skin swab for culture and sensitivity may be recommended.
This helps identify the specific bacteria causing the infection and determines the most effective antibiotics for treatment.

3. NASAL SWABS
3. Nasal swabs
Nasal swabs may be conducted, especially in cases of recurrent infection.
This test can identify staphylococcal nasal carriage, which may require specific management to prevent further episodes of impetigo.

4. SEROLOGIC TESTING AND ASO RESPONSE
4. Serologic testing and ASO response
The anti-streptolysin O (ASO) response is usually mild in cases of impetigo, so testing for streptococcal antibodies isn't commonly used for diagnosis.
However, it may be done if post-streptococcal kidney infection is suspected following an impetigo outbreak.

5. HIV TESTING IN BULLOUS IMPETIGO
5. HIV Testing in bullous Impetigo
This is done for previously healthy adults presenting with bullous impetigo.
HIV testing should be contemplated to rule out underlying human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

6. SKIN BIOPSY
6. Skin biopsy
In rare cases where the diagnosis is uncertain, particularly with bullous impetigo, or if the condition doesn't improve with treatment, a skin biopsy may be recommended.
This involves removing a small sample of the affected skin for further analysis.

COMPLICATIONS OF IMPETIGO
Complications Of Impetigo

Complications of impetigo can arise if the condition is not promptly and adequately treated. Here are potential complications:

1. Wider Spread Infection
Cellulitis: Infection spreads to surrounding skin.
Lymphangitis: Bacterial involvement in lymphatic vessels.
Septicemia: Presence of bacteria in the bloodstream.

2. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome:A condition caused by toxins released by Staphylococcus aureus, leading to widespread skin damage.

3. Scarlet fever:A streptococcal infection, including impetigo, can sometimes lead to scarlet fever, characterized by a red rash, fever, and sore throat.

4. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN):A rare kidney condition occurring 2–6 weeks post-skin infection with Streptococcus pyogenes, causing inflammation of the kidneys.

5. Rheumatic fever:Untreated streptococcal infections can increase the risk of rheumatic fever, which can affect the heart, joints, skin, and other organs.

6. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome:Rare complication resulting in a diffuse erythematous rash, hypotension, and fever due to toxins released by Streptococcus pyogenes.

7. Postinflammatory pigmentation:Discoloration of the skin as a result of the inflammatory response.

8. Scarring:Particularly associated with a more severe form of impetigo and ecthyma, leading to deeper skin damage.
ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR IMPETIGO
Alternative Therapies For Impetigo

While complementary and alternative therapies can offer supportive benefits, they are not a substitute for conventional medical treatment. Here are some complementary and alternative therapies that have been explored for impetigo:

1. TOPICAL DISINFECTANTS
1. Topical Disinfectants
Some studies suggest non-antibiotic treatments like disinfectant soaps may help, but the evidence is weak, and they are not as effective as topical antibiotics.

Research comparing disinfectants like hexachlorophene and hydrogen peroxide with antibiotics found topical antibiotics to be more effective in treating impetigo.

2. RETAPAMULIN THERAPY
2. Retapamulin Therapy
Retapamulin, derived from an edible mushroom, works by stopping bacterial protein synthesis and is effective against S. aureus and S. pyogenes but not MRSA.

While retapamulin shows good clinical results for impetigo, it may not fully eliminate bacteria.
LIVING WITH IMPETIGO
