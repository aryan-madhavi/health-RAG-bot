ANXIETY
AnxietyAlso known as Anxiety disorder.
OVERVIEW
Overview
Anxiety refers to a feeling ofstress, worry, or nervousness as a reaction to difficult and stressful situations. Some feelings of being anxious are completely natural; they even help you become productive in dealing with challenging situations. However, a feeling of intense fear, worry, and panic about day-to-day situations that interfere with your daily life and surroundings to a great extent is a psychiatric condition called anxiety disorder.


A rapid heartbeat, sweating, fatigue, irritability, feeling of dread, racing thoughts, and difficulty concentrating are some of the symptoms of anxiety. Factors like a family history of anxiety, childhood adversity, substance misuse, chronic illness, or high-stress environments can increase the risk. Anxiety disorders are the most common types of mental health conditions and are twice as likely to affect females as males.




If episodes of anxiety become too frequent and severe, and start affecting your quality of life and everyday behavior, it is essential to seek professional help. Medications, psychotherapy, and lifestyle modifications can help alleviate the symptoms of anxiety.

CAUSES OF ANXIETY
Causes Of Anxiety

Our brain produces certain chemicals which are known asneurotransmitters,which help us deal with anxiety. The neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid are related to our mood and emotions. Any imbalance of these neurotransmitters can lead to symptoms of anxiety and other anxiety-related disorders.


The causes of anxiety disorder are not very clear. Some people experience severe anxiety in certain situations, while others take similar conditions with ease. More focused studies are required to fully understand the reason. However, it is thought to be due to a complex interaction of genetics, environmental factors, and lifestyle choices.

We'll explore the risk factors in greater detail in the next section.
RISK FACTORS OF ANXIETY
Risk Factors Of Anxiety

While anyone can experience anxiety, several factors are known to increase the likelihood of developing an anxiety disorder. These include:

FAMILY HISTORY
Family history

Individuals with a parent or sibling diagnosed with an anxiety disorder are at increased risk, due to genetic and environmental factors.

ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES
Adverse childhood experiences

Early-life trauma, including emotional, physical, or sexual abuse or neglect, can alter stress regulation systems, increasing anxiety risk.

TRAUMATIC LIFE EVENTS
Traumatic life events

The sudden loss of a loved one, accidents, assaults, or exposure to violence are strong risk factors for the development of anxiety disorders.

SUBSTANCE USE

DIAGNOSIS OF ANXIETY
Diagnosis Of Anxiety

The diagnosis of an anxiety disorder is primarily clinical, based on a detailed evaluation of the person’s symptoms, medical and psychiatric history, and how these symptoms affect their daily functioning.

A mental health professional or primary care provider will often use structured interviews and standardized screening tools to assess the presence and severity of anxiety. Commonly used tools include:

GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7):This is a short 7-question quiz used to check how often you feel worried, nervous, or restless.

Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A):This is a checklist used by doctors to measure how severe your anxiety symptoms are.

Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI):This consists of a 21-question self-test that helps you understand how much anxiety is affecting your body and mind.




There are no lab tests that can directly diagnose anxiety. However, to rule out medical conditions that can mimic or worsen anxiety symptoms, a physician may order:



Complete blood count:Done to look for signs of an infection or inflammation in the body
Thyroid profile total:This test is done to rule out any potential cause of thyroid disorders
Alcohol screen blood: Thisis a blood test to rule out symptoms caused due to alcohol abuse
Drugs of abuse (qualitative) panel:This has a series of blood tests to check if there are any underlying side effects of medicines
Electrocardiogram(ECG):This is an imaging test to rule out cardiac causes of palpitations or chest discomfort.
