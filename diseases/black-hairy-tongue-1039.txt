BLACK HAIRY TONGUE
Black Hairy TongueAlso known as Lingua villosa nigra, Hyperkeratosis of the tongue.
OVERVIEW
Overview

Black hairy tongue (BHT) is a relatively common, harmless condition that affects up to 13% of people. It presents as a dark, “hairy” coating on the tongue's surface, which, although alarming, is both painless and temporary. BHT can occur at any age but is more frequently seen in older adults, particularly men.

The condition arises when the filiform papillae, tiny bumps on the tongue, fail to shed properly. These papillae grow longer, trapping food particles, bacteria, and fungi, which leads to the characteristic discoloration. Contributing factors include poor oral hygiene, smoking, excessive coffee or tea consumption, certain medications (like antibiotics), and a diet low in roughage.

Symptoms often include a hairy or ticklish sensation on the tongue, bad breath, and occasionally an altered sense of taste. Diagnosis is straightforward, based on the tongue’s appearance. Treatment involves improving oral hygiene by brushing the tongue, using a scraper, quitting smoking, and addressing any underlying factors. With proper care, BHT typically resolves quickly.

CAUSES OF BLACK HAIRY TONGUE
Causes Of Black Hairy Tongue

Hairy tongue happens when the top of the tongue doesn't get enough stimulation or abrasion, leading to a buildup of keratin (the same protein found in hair). In more severe cases, the papillae on the tongue can grow long, making it look like the tongue's surface is covered with hair. When these papillae don’t shed properly, food, bacteria, and sometimes yeast can get trapped, creating a mesh-like effect.

This buildup can cause the tongue to change color, appearing brown, white, green, or pink, depending on the cause. Certain mouthwashes, candy, or even specific bacteria and yeast can make the tongue look black, known as "black hairy tongue."
RISK FACTORS OF BLACK HAIRY TONGUE
Risk Factors Of Black Hairy Tongue


Black hairy tongue is usually harmless, but several factors can increase the chances of developing it. These include:

Poor oral hygiene:Not brushing or cleaning the tongue can lead to a buildup of dead cells and bacteria.


Tobacco Use:Smoking or using tobacco products can cause discoloration and lengthening of the papillae.

Excessive coffee/black tea consumption:Drinking lots of coffee or black tea can stain the tongue and encourage bacteria growth.


Alcohol and intravenous drug use:Alcohol abuse and intravenous drug use are recognized risk factors for black hairy tongue.


Xerostomia (dry mouth):Dry mouth, often caused by medications or medical conditions, creates an environment where bacteria thrive on the tongue.


Medication use:Some medications, like antibiotics or bismuth-containing products (e.g., Pepto-Bismol), can disrupt the mouth's bacteria balance.


Weak immune system:Illnesses that weaken the immune system, such as HIV or cancer, can make it harder to control mouth bacteria.

Recent radiation therapy:Radiation therapy to the head and neck region is an important risk factor for black hairy tongue.

Diet:Liquid diets or foods that lower the tongue's pH, like herbal teas and sugars, may encourage bacterial growth.

Certain medications:Both systemic and local medications, including antibiotics like penicillin, aureomycin, erythromycin, doxycycline, and neomycin, have been implicated in the development of black hairy tongue.

Age and Gender:It is more common in older adults and affects men three times more often than women.

Underlying medical conditions:Certain medical conditions, like HIV, advanced cancer, trigeminal neuralgia, and general illness, can raise the risk of black hairy tongue. Trigeminal neuralgia, specifically, limits tongue movement, which prevents the normal shedding of the tongue's surface cells.Did you know?
Using mouthwashes with oxidizing agents like sodium perborate, sodium peroxide, and hydrogen peroxide can lead to black hairy tongue. Opt for a mouthwash without these ingredients if you've noticed your tongue turning black after trying a new one.

DIAGNOSIS OF BLACK HAIRY TONGUE
Diagnosis Of Black Hairy Tongue

The diagnosis of black hairy tongue is usually straightforward and made through a clinical examination by a doctor or dentist. The condition is visually recognizable by the darkened and elongated filiform papillae on the tongue’s surface. The following steps are typically involved in the diagnosis:

I. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
I. Physical examination
A doctor or dentist will visually inspect the tongue to evaluate its color, texture, and any abnormalities. This examination helps rule out other potential causes of tongue discoloration, such as fungal infections (like oral thrush) or other underlying medical conditions.

II. LABORATORY TESTS
II. Laboratory tests
1. Oral swab test:A swab from the tongue can be taken to identify any bacterial overgrowth contributing to black hairy tongue. This helps determine if specific bacteria are causing the discoloration or elongation of the papillae.

2. Fungal scrapings:Scrapings from the affected area may be analyzed to check for fungal infections, such as yeast, which can also lead to a black hairy tongue.

3. Tongue biopsy:In rare cases, a biopsy of the tongue tissue may be performed to rule out other conditions or confirm the diagnosis. This ensures that no underlying health issues are present.

If you suspect you have a black hairy tongue, it’s important to seek professional advice for proper diagnosis and treatment.
