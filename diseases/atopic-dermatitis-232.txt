ATOPIC DERMATITIS
Atopic dermatitisAlso known as Atopic eczema
OVERVIEW
Overview

Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is a long-lasting skin condition causing itchy, red, and dry patches. It often starts in childhood and can continue into adulthood with occasional flare-ups.

Atopic dermatitis is caused by genetic, immune, and environmental factors that disrupt the skin barrier. Common triggers include allergens like pollen, pet dander, certain foods, and environmental factors like dry or cold weather.

Managing atopic dermatitis includes moisturizing, avoiding triggers, and using prescribed medications to reduce inflammation and itching. Though there's no cure, following a good skincare routine and seeking a doctor’s advice can help control symptoms and provide relief.

CAUSES OF ATOPIC DERMATITIS
Causes Of Atopic Dermatitis

Atopic dermatitis is a complicated condition that comes from several different causes. These include

1. SKIN BARRIER DYSFUNCTION
1. Skin barrier dysfunction
In atopic dermatitis, the skin's outer layer (stratum corneum) is weakened, causing excess water loss and dryness.
This damaged barrier lets irritants, allergens, and microbes enter easily, leading to inflammation and worsening the condition.

2. ALTERED IMMUNE RESPONSE
2. Altered immune response
The immune system in affected individuals tends to overreact to triggers like allergens, leading to inflammation and itching.
T cells and other immune cells release inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, which contribute to persistent skin inflammation.

3. DISRUPTION OF THE SKIN'S MICROBIAL BALANCE
3. Disruption of the skin's microbial balance
The skin's microbial composition is important in maintaining a healthy skin barrier and immune function.
In atopic dermatitis, the balance of microorganisms on the skin's surface is disrupted, leading to an overgrowth of harmful bacteria and a decrease in beneficial microbes.
This dysfunction further exacerbates inflammation and contributes to atopic dermatitis.

LIVING WITH ATOPIC DERMATITIS
Living With Atopic Dermatitis

Atopic dermatitis can severely impact quality of life, affecting relationships, work, and overall happiness due to its chronic itching, pain, and skin issues. This can limit daily activities, clothing choices, and social engagements.

Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, can cause itching, irritation, and sensitivity in your skin. Follow these dermatologist-approved tips to ease discomfort and minimize flare-ups.

1. Hydrate and Moisturize:Apply fragrance-free cream or ointment after bathing or whenever your skin feels dry to create a protective barrier.

Quick tip:Seal in moisture after a bath or shower by immediately applying moisturizer to your skin.

Buy Moisturizer

2. Avoid fragrances:Choose skincare products labeled "fragrance-free" to prevent triggering eczema flares. Avoid products labeled "unscented" as they can still contain hidden fragrances.

3. Patch test new products:Test a small amount of a new skincare product on your inner arm for 7-10 days to ensure it doesn't cause a reaction before using it on your skin.

4. Quick, moisturizing baths:Enjoy brief 5-10 minute baths or showers with warm water to keep your skin hydrated. Afterward, apply moisturizer right away to seal in the moisture.

5. Identify triggers:Determine what triggers your eczema and avoid these substances to reduce flare-ups. Eczema-prone skin is sensitive and can react to various everyday factors.

6. Skin-friendly clothing and detergent:Opt for loose-fitting 100% cotton clothing, avoid wool against the skin, and use fragrance-free, dye-free laundry detergent. Wash new clothes before wearing them. Use 100% cotton towels and sheets for additional relief.

7. Manage temperature exposure:Protect your skin from extreme temperatures like cold weather can dry the skin, while overheating and sweating can trigger eczema flare-ups. You can also use a humidifier if dry air makes your skin dry.

To prevent Staphylococcus aureus skin infections, consider these options for controlling colonization in severe or stubborn cases:

Use a sodium hypochlorite body wash during bath or shower.
Apply intranasal mupirocin twice a day for 5 days.
Try bleach-bath therapy by adding a small amount of bleach (one teaspoon per gallon of water in a toddler tub) to reduce bacteria and skin inflammation, thereby alleviating symptoms.
