MOUTH ULCERS
Mouth ulcersAlso known as Oral Ulcers, Canker Sores, Mouth Sores, Aphthous Ulcers
OVERVIEW
Overview
Mouth ulcers are usually small, painful sores or lesions that develop on the soft lining of the mouth. Anyone can get mouth ulcers and they are usually harmless. There is no definite cause of these ulcers however, factors like emotional stress, lack of sleep, certain nutritional deficiencies, trauma due to hard brushing, accidental bites or some allergies and infections are known to trigger them.

Most mouth ulcers heal on their own or with over-the-counter (OTC) products within one to two weeks. But if they last longer than three weeks and are recurrent in nature or extremely painful, they may require medical attention.

Ulcers cannot be prevented, but certain lifestyle modifications may help relieve symptoms and reduce their frequency. Various OTC products, such as oral gels, mouthwashes, etc., are available to provide relief from them. Prescription medicines are required in case of recurrent and non-healing ulcers.

Chronic or recurrent mouth ulcers can be a cause of severe frustration and pain. The person may not be able to enjoy their favorite foods and is at an increased risk of malnutrition.
