ULCERATIVE COLITIS
Ulcerative colitis
OVERVIEW
Overview

Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes inflammation and ulcers in your digestive tract. It is a chronic condition that affects the innermost lining of your large intestine (colon) and rectum.

Individuals with ulcerative colitis generally present with diarrhea and blood in the stools, other symptoms can be stomach cramps, fatigue, weight loss, and fever in severe cases.

It generally affects the middle age group, but children can also be affected by it. The exact cause is still unknown but the use of medications like NSAIDs, antibiotics, and contraceptives along with diet plays an important role in the development of this disease.

Ulcerative colitis is a condition with phases of relapse and remission. Drinking enough water, eating foods that are low in fiber, avoiding certain medications, and staying away from smoking can reduce the risk of ulcerative colitis to a greater extent.

Treatment mainly consists of managing the symptoms and there are several new treatments that can greatly reduce the discomfort and bring about long-term remission.

SYMPTOMS OF ULCERATIVE COLITIS
Symptoms Of Ulcerative Colitis


Ulcerative colitis is a chronic disease affecting the colonic mucosa (inner layer of the large intestine) that most commonly presents with blood in the stool and diarrhea. Almost15%of patients can initially present with severe forms of the disease. Symptoms include:
Bleeding from rectumUrgencyFeeling of the need to pass stoolAbdominal pains and crampsFever (in severe cases)Urinary incontinence(loss of bladder control)FatigueIncreased frequency of bowel movementsMucus dischargeRectal painWeight lossBowel movements at nightWeight loss (in severe cases)Involvement of muscles and skin.

Note:Symptoms are similar in kids with ulcerative colitis (pediatric ulcerative colitis) and may also include delayed or poor growth.

TYPES OF ULCERATIVE COLITIS
Types Of Ulcerative Colitis

Ulcerative colitis can affect different parts of your colon and rectum and the intensity of your condition depends on the amount of inflammation and the area affected. The major types include:

Ulcerative proctitis:In this type, bowel inflammation is limited only to the rectum and typically affects less than six inches of the rectum. Ulcerative proctitis is not associated with an increased risk of cancer.

Left-sided colitis:In this form of ulcerative colitis, there is continuous inflammation that begins at the rectum and extends up to the splenic flexure (a bend in the colon near the spleen).

Proctosigmoiditis:In this form of ulcerative colitis, inflammation is limited to rectum and sigmoid colon (lower end of the colon) only.

Extensive colitis:This type of ulcerative colitis affects the entire colon with continuous inflammation beginning at the rectum and extending beyond the splenic flexure (bend in your colon to meet the stomach).
CAUSES OF ULCERATIVE COLITIS
Causes Of Ulcerative Colitis

Ulcerative colitis generally begins in the rectum and may remain localized or extend proximally, sometimes involving the entire colon (the longest part of the large intestine). But, It rarely involves the entire bowel at once. The exact cause of ulcerative colitis still remains unknown, however, there are numerous risk factors that can lead to its development.

Both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are characterized by bowel symptoms which can be seen in25-40%of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

RISK FACTORS FOR ULCERATIVE COLITIS
Risk Factors For Ulcerative Colitis


Ulcerative colitis is a multifactorial condition and the risk factors include:
1. AGE
1. Age
Studiesshow that the onset of ulcerative colitis is seen at a younger age, i.e less than 40 years. And the main onset peaks between 15 and 30 years of age.
2. RACE

2. Race
Ulcerative colitis was previously considered to be a disease of Caucasian patients, butstudieshave documented increased incidences among non-white populations as well.
3. FAMILY HISTORY OF IBD

3. Family history of IBD
Studiessuggests that the strongest identifiable risk factor for the development of Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a positive family history. IBD consists of Crohn's disease (causing swelling of the digestive tract) and ulcerative colitis.


4. MEDICATIONS
4. Medications
Drugs that can increase the likelihood of the development of ulcerative colitis include:
Contraceptive pills:Studiesshow that the use of combined oral contraceptive pills was associated with the development of ulcerative colitis.

Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs):These are pain medications that have been shown to be associated with flare-ups of the disease.

Antibiotics:These have been shown to precipitate flare-ups of the disease for some people.

5. SMOKING
5. Smoking
Former cigarette smoking is one of the strongest risk factors associated with ulcerative colitis.Studiesdemonstrate that active smokers are less likely to develop ulcerative colitis compared with former and non-smokers.

6. APPENDECTOMY

6. Appendectomy
It is a surgery to remove the appendix (a small, thin pouch connected to the large intestine) when it is infected.Researchshows that a history of appendectomy in patients with ulcerative colitis is rare.
7. DIET

7. Diet
Though it is a less common risk factor for ulcerative colitis, increased consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids (a type of dietary fat found in salmon, nuts, etc) may contribute to issues with digestive health that can lead to ulcerative colitis.
8. CHILDHOOD HYGIENE

8. Childhood hygiene
Low hygiene and exposure to infections may be associated with an increased risk for ulcerative colitis, especially in kids.
DIAGNOSIS OF ULCERATIVE COLITIS
Diagnosis Of Ulcerative Colitis

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic illness that is usually detected only at the later stages. Diagnosis consists of the following investigations:

1. MEDICAL HISTORY
1. Medical history
A thorough history, including travel history to rule out other causes along with detailed drug history and recent antibiotic use should be considered.
2. LABORATORY TESTS

2. Laboratory tests
These tests are done to diagnose anemia, thrombocytosis (a condition in which the body produces platelets in excess), low vitamin D and raised inflammatory markers Tests include:
Complete blood count (CBC)Blood ureaSerum electrolytesC-reactive proteinVitamin D profileBone profileIron serumFolate test (Vitamin B9)Vitamin B12 testLiver function tests

3. STOOL CULTURES
3. Stool cultures
These are done to determine if there are any infections. The stool culture should be negative in case of ulcerative colitis, but bacterial infections such as C difficile can co-exist.

4. FECAL CALPROTECTIN
4. Fecal calprotectin
It is a very sensitive marker for inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, and useful for the differentiation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

5. IMAGING TESTS
5. Imaging tests
Colonoscopy or proctosigmoidoscopy:It might reveal loss of typical vascular pattern, granularity, friability, and ulceration that involves the rectum.

Sigmoidoscopy:It helps in examining the level and extent of bowel inflammation.A sigmoidoscopy can also be used to remove a small sample of tissue from your bowel so it can be tested in a laboratory.

Endoscopy:It helps in examining the inside of your colon and rectum with a lighted tube inserted through your anus.

Abdominal X-ray:Plain abdominal radiographs are useful for acute onset of ulcerative colitis. They are often entirely normal in inflammatory bowel disease.

CTscan orMRI:These are used for small bowel imaging and can help differentiate between ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.

6. BIOPSY
6. Biopsy
Usually at least two biopsies from each bowel segment for histological assessment is recommended. However, no histological features are diagnostic of ulcerative colitis, but distortion irregularity can suggest ulcerative colitis.

TREATMENT OF ULCERATIVE COLITIS
Treatment Of Ulcerative Colitis


Ulcerative colitis can progress proximally in10–19%of patients after 5 years, and in up to 28% of patients at 10 years. The primary aim of medical management is to induce and maintain remission.

Staging of ulcerative colitis based on the severity of disease:

The severity of ulcerative colitis can be graded depending upon rectal bleeding. It includes:
Mild:Less than four rectal bleeding episodes per day
Moderate:More than four rectal bleeding episodes per day
Severe:More than four rectal bleeding episodes per day along with systemic features of an illness combined with hypoalbuminemia (a condition in which there is lack of albumin protein that's responsible for keeping fluid in your blood vessels).

Treatment depends on the stage of ulcerative colitis and it consists of:
A. IN MILD-MODERATE ULCERATIVE COLITIS
A. In mild-moderate ulcerative colitis
Mesalamines:These are the first-line therapy for induction of remission in mild-moderate cases of ulcerative colitis. There are different formulations of mesalamine, including oral, suppository, or liquid enema.
Corticosteroids:Second-line therapies for patients who do not respond to mesalamine are corticosteroids. The drugs used are:
Prednisone
Budesonide-multimatrix (MMX)

B. IN MODERATE-SEVERE ULCERATIVE COLITIS
B. In moderate-severe ulcerative colitis


1. Immunomodulators:These are drugs that modulate the immune system by working on the underlying inflammatory processes. They include:InfliximabAdalimumabGolimumabVedolizumabTofacitinib
C. IN ACUTE SEVERE ULCERATIVE COLITIS

C. In acute severe ulcerative colitis


It is defined as the presence of more than 6 bloody stools per day with increased heart rate, fever, and signs of infection.
Medications include:InfliximabCyclosporineSteroids.

D. MAINTENANCE OF REMISSION

D. Maintenance of remission
Most appropriate maintenance treatment for an individual patient is established by several factors, like disease extent and severity, treatment for induction of remission, and failure of previous maintenance treatments.Mesalazineis the basis of treatment for the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis.
E. SURGERY

E. Surgery
Absolute indications for surgery include uncontrolled bleeding, perforation, and colorectal cancer. Surgery is also indicated in acute severe ulcerative colitis and the most commonly performed surgery for ulcerative colitis are:
Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA):This surgery removes the entire colon and rectum while preserving the seal in the anus for normal bowel functioning and to avoid fecal incontinence.
Total proctocolectomy:It is a surgery to remove all of the colon and rectum that may be indicated if there are intestinal manifestations.

F. THE NEWER AGENT

COMPLICATIONS OF ULCERATIVE COLITIS
Complications Of Ulcerative Colitis


Ulcerative colitis is a chronic disease with periods of remission and relapse. Here are complications that can occur from ulcerative colitis:
Pelvic abscess:It is pus-filled lesions in the lower stomach due to inflammation.

Enterocutaneous fistulas:These are the abnormal connections between the intestines or stomach and the skin. They occur due to leakage of contents of the stomach or intestines into the skin after bowel surgery.

Bowel obstruction:Studieshave shown that early postoperative small-bowel obstruction occurs in up to 15% of patients after surgery for ulcerative colitis.

Pouch prolapse:Researchdemonstrates that it is a rare but important complication to consider in patients with ulcerative colitis who have undergone a total proctocolectomy.

Poor growth and development:Individuals with ulcerative colitis and undergoing treatment for the same can have poor growth and delayed puberty.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis:Individuals with ulcerative colitis may develop another digestive condition called primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). In PSC the bile ducts become progressively inflamed and damaged.

Pouchitis:It is an inflammation in the lining of a pouch created during surgery in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

Incontinence:Individuals with ulcerative colitis are generally affected by fecal incontinence, i.e. inability to control bowel movement.
Osteoporosis:Individuals with ulcerative colitis are at an increased risk of developing osteoporosis, when the bones become weak and are more likely to fracture.

Sexual dysfunction:Certain medications used to treat ulcerative colitis can impact their sex drive and ability to have sex.

Toxic megacolon:It is swelling and inflammation that spread into the deeper layers of your colon.

Colonor rectal cancer:The risk of cancer in individuals with ulcerative colitis increases by2%after 10 years of diagnosis.

Leakage from anastomosis:This is a serious complication after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) leading to postoperative sepsis and pouch failure.Did you know?Coronavirus can trigger ulcerative colitis.
