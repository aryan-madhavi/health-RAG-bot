SICKLE CELL ANEMIA
Sickle cell anemiaAlso known as HBSS disease
OVERVIEW
Overview
Sickle cell anemia is a rare inherited blood disorder in which the body produces defective hemoglobin (HBSS). This form of hemoglobin causes the RBCs to become rigid and sickle-shaped.

These cells often get stuck and clog the capillaries, leading to insufficient blood supply to different parts of the body. Symptoms include yellow skin, dark urine, whitening of the eyes,tiredness, fussiness, swelling of the hands and feet, and shortness of breath.

Bone marrow transplantation is the only cure for this condition. However, medications and blood transfusions are used to manage the symptoms.

Sickle cell disease impacts the individual physically and emotionally. Seeking good medical care and going for periodic checkups helps avoid complications.

CAUSES OF SICKLE CELL ANEMIA
Causes Of Sickle Cell Anemia

RBCs are round-shaped cells that contain hemoglobin. Hemoglobin, which comprises heme (iron) and globin (protein), carries oxygen throughout the body.

Due to their round shape, RBCs can easily move through small blood vessels.

WHAT IS SICKLE CELL ANEMIA (SCA) AND HOW IS IT CAUSED?
What is sickle cell anemia (SCA) and how is it caused?
SCA is characterized by a defective hemoglobin called hemoglobin S (HBSS).

This form of hemoglobin causes the RBCs to become rigid and sickle-shaped. These cells often get stuck and clog the capillaries. This leads to insufficient blood supply to different parts of the body.

The abnormal RBCs also die early (hemolysis) and eventually cause anemia – a lack of red blood cells. Insufficient blood supply can cause a range of symptoms.

The two possible causes of SCA are:
Inheritance (passed from parent to child)
Mutation (change in the DNA sequence that codes for hemoglobin)
SYMPTOMS OF SICKLE CELL ANEMIA
Symptoms Of Sickle Cell Anemia

In most cases, newborns do not have symptoms during the initial 5 to 6 months because the hemoglobin produced by the developing fetus (fetal hemoglobin) safeguards the RBCs from sickling. This fetal hemoglobin is absent in the RBCs that are created after birth. Thus, by 5 months of age, the sickling of the red blood cells becomes prominent, and symptoms begin.

Symptoms can vary from person to person and can change over time. The frequency of symptoms also varies depending on the hemoglobin level in the blood.  Symptoms also vary as per the age of the individual.

Sudden weakness
Numbness on one side of the body
Confusion
Trouble in speaking, seeing, or walkingDid you know?

RISK FACTORS FOR SICKLE CELL ANEMIA
Risk Factors For Sickle Cell Anemia

The risk factors of sickle cell anemia include:

1. FAMILY HISTORY
1. Family history
SCA runs in families and is strongly associated with a positive family history. If the first child has SCA, there is a 25% chance of getting it in the second child.

2. ETHNICITY
2. Ethnicity
Sickle cell disease is more common in certain ethnic groups. Around 1 out of every 12 individuals with sickle cell disease are African-Americans. People of Middle Eastern, Asian, Indian, Hispanic-Americans and Mediterranean descent are also more prone to SCA.
DIAGNOSIS OF SICKLE CELL ANEMIA
Diagnosis Of Sickle Cell Anemia

The diagnosis of SCA is made through:


1. SCREENING TESTS
1. Screening tests
The screening tests consist of the following blood tests to check the hemoglobin level and other blood parameters:
Complete blood count: This test gives a full blood profile and its components. Individuals with hemophilia have an abnormal CBC. SCA is characterized by a reduction in red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin, and hematocrit (% volume of red blood cells)
Peripheral blood smear: This test also evaluates different components of the blood. A drop of blood placed on a glass plate is treated with various stains. It is, then, observed under a microscope.
Sickling test: In this test, the blood is mixed with a reagent. The turbid appearance indicates the presence of abnormal hemoglobin.

QUICK BYTE
Quick Byte
Neonatal screening (NBS) for SCD is done at the time of birth. The purpose of neonatal screening is to detect both sickle cell disease (SCD) and sickle cell trait (AS) which help identify the carriers. Apart from this, early diagnosis and treatment would be possible by screening in the neonatal period.

2. CONFIRMATORY TESTS
2. Confirmatory tests
Hemoglobin electrophoresis: This test separates different variants of hemoglobin based on their size and electrical charge.
Isoelectric focusing: This test also determines abnormal hemoglobin.
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC): This technique separates the different types of hemoglobin fractions due to their various interactions with a solvent.
Genetic test: The genetic test precisely detects the various types of sickle cell disease. The test analyzes the DNA sequence change leading to sickle cell disease development.

3. PRENATAL TESTING
3. Prenatal testing
Women with a family history of SCA are recommended to undergo prenatal screening at week 8 to 10. Two methods for prenatal testing:
CVS (chorionic villus sampling): A tissue sample is taken from the placenta to test for genetic abnormalities.
Amniocentesis: It involves an examination of amniotic fluid (fluid around the baby).


Here are some medical tests that are recommended during pregnancy.

PREVENTION OF SICKLE CELL ANEMIA
Prevention Of Sickle Cell Anemia

Sickle cell anemia is an inherited genetic condition. Hence, there is no way to prevent it for someone who is born with it.

Therefore, the following points are advocated to reduce the number of children born with the disease. These strategies are usually initiated at community level and involve:

Raising awareness and providing counseling before marriage or conception
Establishing genetic counseling and testing centers in high prevalence areas
SPECIALIST TO VISIT

Severe anemia can sometimes lead to:
Aplastic crisis (condition in which bone marrow stops producing new red blood cells suddenly)
Splenic sequestration crisis (acute severe drop in hemoglobin due to entrapment of red blood cells in spleen)

Note:The above two conditions most commonly occur in newborns and children who have sickle cell disease.
ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR SICKLE CELL ANEMIA
Alternative Therapies For Sickle Cell Anemia

SCA is a chronic and severe disease that can have serious life-threatening complications. So, it is essential to remember that alternative treatments cannot replace medical treatment. They can be considered alongside conventional medical treatments.
Some alternative therapies may include:
1. HEAT MASSAGE
1. Heat massage
Studies have shown that applying heat is associated with a decrease in pain crisis, anxiety, depression, and better overall functioning. However, more research is needed to understand the impact of massage on SCD.

This therapy helps reduce the perception of pain by modulating the emotional responses to pain. It includes:
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) manages problems by changing the way you think and behave. In CBT, individuals are taught to differentiate emotional and behavioral reactions from a triggering event, such as pain.
Mindfulness and mind-body techniques, such as meditation, help reduce chronic pain by heightening one’s level of awareness.
LIVING WITH SICKLE CELL ANEMIA
Living With Sickle Cell Anemia

Sickle cell disease impacts the individual both physically and emotionally. Most people with sickle cell disease can enjoy most of the activities like others do. The following lifestyle interventions help in preventing complications and aid in improving the overall quality of life:

1. GET VACCINATED
1. Get vaccinated
Proper vaccination helps prevent infections associated with sickle cell anemia. Enroll in routine immunizations that cover the diseases that are at high risk in sickle cell anemia, including pneumonia and meningococcal vaccines.


2. Avoid trigger situations
Any sudden changes in temperature and pressure serve as a trigger for the symptoms of SCA. These situations can be minimized through simple techniques:
Easing into the water rather than jumping while swimming
Avoiding high altitudes journey

Certain conditions aggravate the sickle cell crisis. So, it is advisable to limit/avoid these triggers:
Heavy physical labor
Alcohol
Smoking
