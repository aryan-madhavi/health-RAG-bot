FEBRILE SEIZURE
Febrile SeizureAlso known as  Febrile convulsions
OVERVIEW
Overview

Febrile seizures are convulsive episodes that typically occur in infants and young children aged six months to five years, triggered by a sudden rise in body temperature due to a fever. These seizures are relatively common, affecting up to 4% of children in this age group, with most cases occurring between six months and six years old.

Fortunately, febrile seizures are generally brief and not harmful, with most children recovering quickly without lasting effects. However, a small percentage of children (2.5% to 5%) who experience complex febrile seizures may have an increased risk of developing epilepsy later in life.

Febrile seizures are classified into two types: simple and complex. Simple febrile seizures are short, lasting less than 15 minutes, and do not recur within 24 hours. In contrast, complex febrile seizures last longer, may occur multiple times within a day, and can include confusion after the episode.

Managing fever during illness is key to preventing febrile seizures. This can be done by using fever-reducing medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, sponging, and ensuring the child stays well-hydrated. Thankfully, most children outgrow febrile seizures by the age of 5 without any lasting issues.

SYMPTOMS OF FEBRILE SEIZURE
Symptoms Of Febrile seizure

Here are the typical symptoms of a febrile seizure-

Loss of consciousness or unresponsiveness (blackout)
Sudden onset without warning
Twitching or jerking of arms and legs
Muscle stiffness
High fever (above 100.4°F / 38°C)
Breathing difficulty
Foaming at the mouth
Bluish skin due to temporary oxygen deprivation

TYPES OF FEBRILE SEIZURE
Types of Febrile Seizure

Febrile seizures can be categorized into two main types based on their characteristics:

1. SIMPLE FEBRILE SEIZURES
1. Simple Febrile Seizures
Most common, accounting for 85% of cases.
Generalized, affecting both sides of the brain.
Lasts less than 5 minutes, with quick recovery.
Does not recur within 24 hours or during illness.

2. COMPLEX FEBRILE SEIZURES
2. Complex Febrile Seizures
Less common, comprising 15% of cases.
Affects one side of the brain or specific body area (partial seizure).
Lasts longer than 15 minutes.
It may recur within 24 hours, with slower recovery.
CAUSES OF FEBRILE SEIZURE
Causes Of Febrile Seizure

While febrile seizures are closely linked to fevers, the exact cause remains unclear. The connection between fever and seizures is intricate, with multiple factors playing a role.
Cytokine Release: During infections, the immune system releases cytokines, which can affect the brain's temperature regulation, leading to fever.
Temperature-induced Changes: A rapid increase in body temperature may disrupt brain activity, potentially triggering seizures in vulnerable individuals.
Immature Brain: Young children are more prone to febrile seizures due to their developing brains being more sensitive to the effects of fever.
Ion Channel Dysfunction: Genetic mutations or variations in brain ion channels can heighten neuron excitability, making the brain more susceptible to fever-induced seizures.

If you’re concerned about febrile seizures, consult with a paediatrician for personalized guidance and care.

RISK FACTORS FOR FEBRILE SEIZURE
Risk Factors For Febrile Seizure

Several factors can increase the risk of a child experiencing a febrile seizure:

Age:Most common in children aged 6 months to 5 years; rare in infants under 6 months and older children.

Family history:Higher risk if there is a family history of febrile seizures or epilepsy (e.g., parent or sibling).

Fever:Rapid rise in body temperature due to infections is a key trigger; not all children with fever will have a febrile seizure.

Viral Infections:Certain viral infections, such as chickenpox and flu, roseola, and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), have been linked to an increased risk of febrile seizures.

Bacterial Infections:High fever from bacterial infections like ear infections, tonsillitis, urinary tract infections, and gastroenteritis can trigger seizures.

Developmental delays:Children with developmental delays or neurological disorders may have a higher risk of febrile seizures.

Low birth weight:Some research suggests that children with low birth weight might be at an increased risk of febrile seizures.

Vaccination:While most vaccines do not significantly increase the risk of febrile seizures, some studies have suggested a slight increase in risk following certain vaccinations. However, the overall benefits of vaccines in preventing serious diseases far outweigh this small risk.

Environmental factors:Rapid changes in environmental temperature, such as overheating, can contribute to triggering a febrile seizure.

Gender:Febrile seizures are slightly more common in boys than girls.Did you know?
Factors indicating a higher chance of recurrent febrile seizures include early age at first seizure, family history, low fever intensity, and shorter intervals between fever onset and seizure.Shop Now
DIAGNOSIS OF FEBRILE SEIZURE
Diagnosis Of Febrile seizure

Diagnosing febrile seizures requires a comprehensive approach, combining medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests. The process involves the following steps-
I. Clinical history
The physician collects detailed information about the child’s medical background, focusing on the seizure event, overall health, and any past instances of fever-related seizures. Information on the seizure’s duration, any unusual symptoms, and changes in behavior before and after the event is also gathered.
II. Physical examination
A thorough physical examination will be conducted to assess the child's overall health and neurological status. The doctor will look for any signs of fever, infection, or other underlying conditions that could contribute to the seizure.
III. Temperature measurements
The presence of fever is a key factor in diagnosing febrile seizures. The doctor will measure the child's body temperature to confirm the presence of a fever at the time of the seizure.
IV. Diagnostic tests
1. Simple Febrile seizures
Blood test:Acomplete blood cell count (CBC)and tests for glucose, electrolytes, etc.
Urine test
A spinal tap (lumbar puncture):This test is important for children with meningitis symptoms, febrile status epilepticus, or specific conditions. It is considered for children under 12 months old with febrile seizures, especially if immunization status is uncertain or deficient.

2. Complex febrile seizures
Electroencephalogram (EEG):An EEG is a diagnostic test that assesses brain activity to identify any unusual patterns that might increase the likelihood of seizures. It is recommended for children who experience prolonged or complex febrile seizures, non-fever-associated recurrences, or have developmental delays.
However, for neurologically healthy children with simple febrile seizures, a routine EEG is generally not necessary.

Computed tomography (CT) scan (head):A CT scan employs X-rays to generate cross-sectional images of the brain, allowing the identification of abnormalities such as tumors, lesions, and bleeding that could be causing seizures.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain:MRI produces very detailed images of the brain by using powerful magnetic and radio waves. It assists doctors in determining the root causes of seizures.

These imaging tests may be considered for children displaying:
Signs of increased intracranial pressure
Focal neurological problems
Suspected structural defects in the brain
Unusually large head size
Severe head injuries.

PREVENTION OF FEBRILE SEIZURE

First-aid tips for Febrile seizure
If your child experiences a febrile seizure, follow these steps to ensure their safety:
Stay calm:Most febrile seizures are brief and generally harmless. Staying calm will help you manage the situation effectively.
Ensure safety:Gently place your child on the floor or a safe surface, away from hard or sharp objects, to prevent injury.
Avoid mouth obstruction:Do not put anything in your child’s mouth, as this could cause choking or dental injury.
No physical restraint:Do not hold your child down or try to stop the seizure physically. Allow the seizure to run its course.Post-seizure care:Roll your child onto their side (recovery position) to keep their airway clear.If your child has food or vomit in their mouth, gently turn their head to the side to prevent choking; do not attempt to remove it forcefully.Observe the duration of the seizure. If it lasts longer than 5 minutes, seek immediate medical help.Treatment of Febrile Seizures
The treatment of febrile seizures focuses on managing the fever, ensuring the child’s safety, and preventing future seizures:
1. ANTIPYRETIC THERAPY
1. Antipyretic therapy
Administer antipyretic medications (such as acetaminophen oribuprofen) to reduce fever and discomfort. Lowering the fever may help prevent the recurrence of seizures.

2. SUPPORTIVE CARE (SEIZURES < 5 MINUTES)
2. Supportive care (Seizures < 5 Minutes)
For febrile seizures lasting less than 5 minutes, the primary approach is supportive care.
This may involve ensuring the child's safety during the seizure, providing comfort, and monitoring their condition.

Note:Typically, medical intervention such as antiseizure medications is not immediately necessary for seizures of this duration.
3. ANTISEIZURE MEDICATIONS (SEIZURES ≥ 5 MINUTES)

3. Antiseizure medications (Seizures ≥ 5 minutes)
Benzodiazepines (likelorazepam,diazepam,midazolam) are commonly used. They can be given intravenously (IV), rectally, or intranasally.
Fosphenytoincan be administered intravenously if the seizure persists.
Phenobarbital,valproate, orlevetiracetammay be used for persistent seizures.

COMPLICATIONS OF FEBRILE SEIZURE
Complications Of Febrile seizure

Febrile seizures, if not managed properly, can have several potential complications affecting a child's well-being. Some common issues include:

Todd's paralysis:After a febrile seizure, some children may experience temporary focal weakness known as Todd's paralysis, which affects muscle control in specific areas.

Mesial temporal sclerosis:Prolonged febrile seizures may increase the risk of mesial temporal sclerosis, a condition that can lead to focal epilepsy later in life.

Increased epilepsy risk:While most children with febrile seizures do not develop epilepsy, those with additional risk factors might face a higher likelihood of developing the condition.

Emotional distress:Witnessing a febrile seizure can be distressing for caregivers, leading to emotional and psychological impact.
Did you know?
The risk of developing epilepsy later is about 1% in cases of simple febrile convulsions, whereas it ranges from 4% to 6% in complex febrile seizures.
