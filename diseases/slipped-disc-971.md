SLIPPED DISC
Slipped discAlso known as Herniated or Ruptured or Bulging disk.
OVERVIEW
Overview

A herniated disc, commonly known as a slipped disc, is a spinal condition that can cause pain and discomfort. The spine is made up of vertebrae cushioned by discs, which consist of a tough outer layer (annulus fibrosus) and a gel-like center (nucleus pulposus). With age, these discs can weaken due to a loss of water content, leading to a herniated disc, often occurring in the lower back (lumbar spine).

When a disc herniates, it can press on nearby spinal nerves, causing symptoms like leg pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness, commonly referred to as sciatica. Sciatica typically affects people between the ages of 30 and 50.

Most cases of herniated discs improve with nonsurgical treatments, with 80-90% of patients finding relief within a few weeks. Surgery is considered if pain persists and interferes with daily activities, with over 90% success in relieving leg pain, though it is less effective for back pain. Surgical intervention focuses on alleviating leg pain and preventing further complications like leg weakness.

SYMPTOMS OF SLIPPED DISC
Symptoms Of Slipped Disc

A slipped (herniated) disc occurs when the disc's inner part pushes out, irritating surrounding nerves and causing inflammation or pain. Symptoms depend on the affected area:


Numbness or tingling:Felt in the arms or legs due to nerve compression.
Muscle weakness:Can cause difficulty in movement or walking.
Pain:Sharp or burning pain, often radiating to the limbs.
Cauda Equina Syndrome:Rare, severe cases may affect bowel or bladder control, needing urgent care.

Location-Based Symptoms:
Lower Back:Pain radiates to the buttocks, thighs, or calves.
Neck:Pain in shoulders and arms, sometimes causing weakness.
Middle Back:Rare but can cause localized pain spreading around the ribs.

Note:Sudden bowel or bladder changes require immediate attention.

ARE YOU CONFUSED BETWEEN A BULGING DISC AND A HERNIATED DISC?
Are you confused between a Bulging disc and a Herniated disc?
A bulging disc occurs when the outer layer of a spinal disc weakens but remains intact, causing it to protrude.
On the other hand, a herniated disc involves a rupture in the disc's outer layer, allowing the inner material to leak, potentially irritating nearby nerves. Both conditions can lead to back pain, but a herniated disc involves more severe structural damage.

CAUSES OF SLIPPED DISC
Causes Of Slipped Disc

Causes of a slipped disc, also known as a herniated or bulging disc, stem from the spine's intricate anatomy.
The spine consists of stacked vertebrae with intervertebral discs between them. These discs have an outer layer (annulus fibrosus) and a gel-like center (nucleus pulposus), providing spinal flexibility and support.

A slipped disc results from damage or weakening of the outer disc layer, allowing the inner gel-like material to herniate. The process involves:

1. Normal disc structure:Discs are located between vertebrae, comprising an outer fibrous layer and a soft inner core.

2. Degeneration and weakening:Aging and wear and tear cause disc degeneration, with the outer layer weakening or developing tears.

3. Herniation:Weakening or tearing of the outer layer allows the inner portion to slip out or herniate, potentially compressing spinal nerves.

4. Nerve compression:Herniated disc material pressing on spinal nerves can lead to various symptoms based on location and severity.

Note:Natural healing may reabsorb herniated material, but severe cases may require medical intervention, such as physical therapy, medications, or surgery.

RISK FACTORS FOR SLIPPED DISC
Risk Factors For Slipped Disc

Several risk factors contribute to the development of a slipped disc (also known as a herniated or ruptured disc). These factors increase the likelihood of disc-related issues, and they include:

1. Age:The risk of a slipped disc tends to increase with age. Discs lose water content and elasticity over time, making them more susceptible to herniation.

2. Genetics:A genetic predisposition may contribute to disc-related problems. Individuals with a family history of disc issues are at an increased risk.

3. Occupation:Jobs involving repetitive or strenuous activities, particularly those requiring heavy lifting, bending, or twisting, can elevate the risk of disc herniation.

6. Gender:Men are generally more susceptible to disc herniation than women.

7. Inactivity:A sedentary lifestyle with little physical activity can contribute to weakened muscles and increased vulnerability to disc problems.

8. Improper lifting techniques:Lifting heavy objects using improper techniques, such as bending at the waist instead of the knees, can strain the spine and increase the risk of disc herniation.

9. Existing spinal conditions:Conditions such as degenerative disc disease or spinal stenosis can predispose individuals to disc issues.

10. Trauma or injury:Acute trauma, such as a fall or injury from an accident, can lead to disc herniation.

11. Frequent driving:Staying seated for long periods, combined with the vibrations from the car engine, can put pressure on your spine and disks.
DIAGNOSIS OF SLIPPED DISC
Diagnosis Of Slipped Disc

Diagnosing a slipped disc involves various measures to identify the presence, location, and severity of the disc herniation. Common diagnostic methods include:

MEDICAL HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Medical history and physical examination
Discussion of symptoms:Your doctor will discuss your symptoms and inquire about your medical history.


Neurological examination:Assessing muscle strength, sensation loss, and reflexes to identify signs of nerve compression.


Straight leg raise (SLR) Test:A specialized test where the doctor lifts your affected leg while you lie on your back. Pain radiating down the leg may indicate a herniated disc, especially in younger patients.



IMAGING STUDIES
Imaging studies
MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):This imaging technique provides detailed images of soft tissues, including intervertebral discs, helping to confirm the diagnosis and identify affected spinal nerves. It is highly effective in identifying disc herniations.


CT (Computed Tomography) Scan:If MRI is not tolerated, a CT scan may be used to visualize the spine, particularly to assess bony structures. They are less detailed for soft tissues compared to MRI.


X-ray:While not as effective in diagnosing disc herniation, X-rays can reveal abnormalities in the spine's bone structure, such as bone spurs or changes in vertebral alignment.


CT Myelogram:In some cases, a contrast dye is injected into the spinal canal, followed by X-rays or CT scans. This helps outline the spinal cord and nerves, making disc herniations more visible.

ELECTROMYOGRAPHY (EMG)ANDNERVE CONDUCTIONSTUDIES (NCS)
Electromyography (EMG)andNerve conductionstudies (NCS)
Measures electrical impulses along nerve roots, peripheral nerves, and muscles. It can help identify ongoing nerve damage, healing from past injuries, or other sites of nerve compression.

DISCOGRAM
Discogram
A contrast dye is injected into a specific disc, and X-rays are taken. This procedure is used less frequently due to advancements in MRI technology.
