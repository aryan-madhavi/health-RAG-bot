STOMACH CANCER
Stomach cancerAlso known as Gastric cancer.
OVERVIEW
Overview
Stomach cancer, or gastric cancer, develops when stomach cells grow uncontrollably, forming tumors. It can spread to other parts of the body if untreated. Symptoms include stomach pain, bloating,nausea, difficulty swallowing, and unexplained weight loss.

Stomach cancer is typically found in the elderly. Men are more likely to be affected than women. Other risk factors for the disease are smoking,obesity, stomach diseases, excessive alcohol consumption, and hereditary conditions.

Depending on the extent of the cancer, treatment options may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these.

CAUSES OF STOMACH CANCER
Causes Of Stomach Cancer
Stomach cancer develops when a genetic mutation (inherited or acquired) occurs in the DNA of stomach cells.DNA is the genetic code that instructs cells on when to grow and when to die.As a result of the mutation, abnormal cells in the stomach begin to grow and divide uncontrollably.

RISK FACTORS FOR STOMACH CANCER
Risk Factors For Stomach Cancer

Stomach cancer is the 5th most common cancer. It is a multifactorial disease associated with several risk factors, which include:
1. STOMACH CONDITIONS
1. Stomach conditions
H.Pylori infection
Chronic gastritis (swelling and inflammation of the stomach)
Pernicious anemia (decrease in red blood cells when the body can't absorb enough vitamin B12)
GERD(stomach acid backing up into the food pipe)
Intestinal metaplasia (a condition in which the normal stomach lining is replaced with the cells that line the intestines)
Gastric polyps (growths of noncancerous cells in the stomach)
Epstein-Barr virus infection
2. AGE
2. Age
Stomach cancer is more common in the elderly. Half of all stomach cancers occur in people aged 75 and above.
3. GENDER
3. Gender
Men are more likely than women to develop stomach cancer.
4. GENETIC FACTORS
4. Genetic factorsPeople who have first-degree relatives with stomach cancer (parents, siblings, or children) are more likely to develop the disease.A family history of genetic syndromes such as Lynch syndrome (an inherited genetic disorder that increases the risk of colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, and other cancers) is likely to increase the risk of stomach cancer.
5. ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
5. Environmental factorsAlcohol and tobacco use.

DIAGNOSIS OF STOMACH CANCER
Diagnosis Of Stomach cancer


To arrive at the diagnosis of any kind of cancer, it is important to understand its staging. The most common way of staging stomach cancer is the TNM staging system, where:

Tstands for Tumor and how many layers of the stomach wall the tumor has penetrated
Nstands for Lymph Nodes and how many lymph nodes have cancer spread to. It also looks at where the lymph nodes are affected and how close to the original tumor.
Mstands for metastasis ie. spread to other parts of the body

Depending on this the cancer is divided into 4 stages. These are:
1. Stage 0:Also known as carcinoma in situ. This stage is distinguished by abnormal cells in the stomach lining. The cells can become malignant (cancerous) in the future.

2. Stage 1:Cancer hasn’t spread beyond the thick muscle in the stomach wall.

3. Stage 2:The cancer has spread to deeper layers of the stomach and may have spread to a number of nearby lymph nodes.

4. Stage 3:The cancerous cells are present in all the layers of the stomach as well as in some of the adjacent organs like the spleen or colon.

5. Stage 4:Cancer has spread to distant organs in the body like the liver, lungs, brain etc. This is referred to as advanced, metastatic, or secondary cancer.

THE DIAGNOSIS CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING:
The diagnosis consists of the following:

1. MEDICAL HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
1. Medical history and physical examination
It entails examining the body to check general signs of health, including looking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that appears unusual. A history of the patient's health habits, as well as previous illnesses and treatments is taken.


2. UPPER ENDOSCOPY
2. Upper endoscopy
Also known as esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).
The doctor will insert an endoscope, which is a thin, flexible, lighted tube with a small video camera on the end, down your throat during this test.
This allows the doctor to examine the lining of your esophagus, stomach, and the first part of your small intestine.


3.ULTRASOUND
3.Ultrasound
An ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the internal organs. There are 2 types of ultrasound devices:
Transabdominal ultrasound:It is the ultrasound to see inside the abdomen and check for abnormalities.
Endoscopic ultrasound EUS:It is an ultrasound done with the help of an endoscope. This is to help find out the size of the cancer and whether it has spread. It can be used to help remove very early-stage cancers without the need for more extensive surgery.


4. BIOPSY
4. Biopsy
A biopsy is the removal of a small amount of tissue for examination under a microscope. It can make a definite diagnosis for most cancers.


5. IMAGING TESTS
5. Imaging TestsX-Ray:A barium meal X-ray or barium swallow involves drinking a chalky liquid containing a substance called barium, which makes your stomach show up on an X-ray. It can reveal abnormalities in the shape, position, narrowing, or obstruction of the stomach that may be indicative of stomach cancer.

Chest X-ray:This can also be done to check if the cancer has spread to the lungs.

Computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan:CT scans involve taking pictures of the stomach at specific times after the intravenous (IV) injection of contrast medium. It can help diagnose the position of a tumor about nearby organs and blood ves

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):An MRI uses magnetic fields to produce detailed images of the body and to measure the tumor’s size.

Positron emission tomography (PET) scan or PET-CT scan:A PET scan is usually combined with a CT scan or MRI scan to detect and visualize abnormal metabolic activity.


6. OTHER TESTS
6. Other testsLaparoscopy:A laparoscopy is a minor procedure in which a laparoscope (a thin, flexible tube with a small video camera on the end) is inserted through a small cut in the belly. It is used by doctors to determine whether stomach cancer has spread.

Electrocardiogram(ECG):It may be performed if surgery is planned or if you are taking medicines that can affect the heart.

HER2 testing:The cancer cells may be tested after biopsy to see if they have too much of a growth-promoting protein called HER2. Cancers with increased levels of HER2 are called HER2-positive.

PREVENTION OF STOMACH CANCER
Prevention Of Stomach Cancer

Cancer prevention is an action taken to lower the chance of getting cancer. Many things in our genes, our lifestyle, and the environment around us may increase or decrease our risk of getting cancer. Some of the ways to prevent stomach cancer include:
1. DIET AND NUTRITION
1. Diet and nutrition
Consume a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins
Reduce consumption of heavily salted, pickled, and smoked foods.
Reduce intake of processed meats.


2. LIFESTYLE CHOICES
2. Lifestyle choices
Quit smoking.
Avoid or limit alcohol consumption.
Maintain a healthy weight.
Engage in regular physical activity, which supports overall health.
Minimize exposure to carcinogens in the workplace.
Protect your skin from excessive sun exposure to prevent skin cancer, which can sometimes metastasize to the stomach.


3. INFECTIONS AND MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS
3. Infections and medical Interventions
Treat and manage Helicobacter pylori infections.
Take medicines to treat a precancerous condition or to keep cancer from starting (chemoprevention).


4. HEALTH MONITORING
4. Health Monitoring
Maintain routine health check-ups for early detection and management of risk factors.

Note:You can prevent certain types of cancer with vaccines. Like BCG vaccines, cancer vaccines protect our body from viruses that can cause diseases that can develop into cancer.
Know MoreDid you know?
Research has shown that the long-term use of aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen can lower the risk of stomach cancer. Since these medications are associated with internal bleeding and other possible health risks in some people, they should only be taken under medical supervision.

TREATMENT OF STOMACH CANCER
Treatment Of Stomach cancer

Treatment for stomach cancer depends on the size, location, and stage of the tumor. It includes:

1. SURGERY
1. Surgery
Surgery is a common treatment for all stages of gastric cancer. The following types of surgery may be used:
Endoscopic resection:In an endoscopic resection, surgical tools can be passed through the endoscope to remove the tumor and part of the normal stomach wall around it.
Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD):These are minimally invasive procedures where abnormal tissues or early-stage tumors are removed from the stomach lining using an endoscope.
Subtotal gastrectomy: In this procedure, only a portion of the stomach is removed, sometimes in conjunction with a portion of the food pipe (in a proximal gastrectomy) or the first part of the small intestine (in a distal gastrectomy). The remaining stomach section is then reattached.
Total gastrectomy:This surgery is performed if the cancer has spread throughout the stomach. The entire stomach, as well as nearby lymph nodes, as well as parts of the esophagus, intestines, pancreas, and other nearby organs, are removed.


2. PALLIATIVE SURGERY FOR UNRESECTABLE CANCER
2. Palliative surgery for unresectable cancer
For people with unresectable stomach cancer, surgery can often still be used to help control cancer or to help prevent or relieve symptoms or complications.
Gastric bypass (gastrojejunostomy):This is accomplished by connecting a section of the small intestine (the jejunum) to the upper part of the stomach, allowing food to exit the stomach via the new connection.
Stent placement:Using an endoscope to place a stent (a hollow metal tube) in the opening aids in keeping the passage open and allows food to pass through.
Feeding tube placement:Some people with stomach cancer are unable to eat or drink enough to obtain adequate nutrition. A feeding tube can be inserted through the skin of the abdomen and into the distal part of the stomach or the small intestine via a minor operation.


3. CHEMOTHERAPY
3. Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy employs anti-cancer drugs that may help shrink the cancer or slow its growth, relieving symptoms and extending lives. Also, chemo can help the radiation work better which is known as chemoradiation.
Adjuvant treatment:In this treatment, chemo is given before surgery for stomach cancer. It often shrinks the tumor and possibly makes surgery easier. It may also help patients live longer lives by preventing cancer from returning.
Neoadjuvant treatment:It is administered after surgery to remove the cancer. The goal of adjuvant chemotherapy is to kill any remaining cancer cells that are too small to see. This can help prevent the cancer from returning.


The most often used drugs for stomach cancer are:
CarboplatinCisplatinCapecitabineDocetaxelFluorouracilIrinotecanOxaliplatinPaclitaxel


4. RADIOTHERAPY
4. Radiotherapy
Radiation therapy resembles an X-ray procedure, but the radiation used is more potent, and it can be applied in various ways to aid in the treatment of stomach cancer.
Before surgery:For some earlier-stage cancers, radiation can be used in conjunction with chemotherapy (chemo) before surgery to shrink cancer and make it easier to remove.
After surgery:Radiation therapy can be used in conjunction with chemotherapy to try to kill any cancer cells that were not removed during surgery.
For cancers that can't be removed by surgery:Radiation therapy may be used to help slow the growth of cancer and alleviate symptoms such as pain, bleeding, or eating difficulties.


5. TARGETED DRUGS AND IMMUNOTHERAPY
5. Targeted drugs and immunotherapy
These drugs in stomach cancer treatment focus on specific traits of cancer cells to hinder their growth and enhance the effectiveness of therapy.
Some medicines help the body's defense system fight against cancer, known as immunotherapy.

Examples of targeted drugs include:RamucirumabEntrectinibTrastuzumabRegorafenib
