URINARY BLADDER CANCER
Urinary bladder cancerAlso known as Bladder cancer
OVERVIEW
Overview

The bladder is a hollow organ that stores urine and plays a crucial role in eliminating waste from the body. Urinary bladder cancer is the 9th most common cancer worldwide. It arises from abnormal cell growth in the bladder lining. This occurs when the normal process of cell regeneration is disrupted, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation within the bladder.

Blood in urine, frequent urination, pain during urination, and pelvic pain are some common symptoms of bladder cancer. It affects older individuals, with men being more susceptible than women. Risk factors include smoking, exposure to certain chemicals, advanced age, and a history of chronic bladder inflammation.

Early detection is key to better treatment outcomes, underscoring the importance of regular screenings, especially for high-risk individuals. Treatment options vary depending on the cancer's stage and may involve surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these.

TYPES OF URINARY BLADDER CANCER
Types Of Urinary Bladder Cancer
Bladder cancer can be described based on its invasiveness:
1. Noninvasive:This includes growths that haven't spread deep into the bladder.

2. Non-muscle-invasive:Also known as stage I, it has not penetrated the muscle layer of the bladder.

3. Muscle-invasive:Cancer has spread into the bladder muscle, potentially affecting surrounding tissues or organs.

CAUSES OF URINARY BLADDER CANCER
Causes Of Urinary Bladder Cancer

Changes occurring in the DNA of normal bladder cells can lead to abnormal growth and cancer formation. DNA is the basic building block in our cells that carries genes, which control how we look and how our body works.
Specific genes govern the growth, division, and survival of cells:


Oncogenes:These genes promote cell growth, division, and longevity.
Tumor suppressor genes:They typically regulate cell division, DNA repair, and programmed cell death.


The onset of cancer can be attributed to DNA alterations, known as gene mutations, which either activate oncogenes or deactivate tumor suppressor genes. Multiple gene mutations are typically required for a cell to progress into cancer.
RISK FACTORS FOR URINARY BLADDER CANCER

DIAGNOSIS OF URINARY BLADDER CANCER
Diagnosis Of Urinary Bladder Cancer

Understanding the staging of urinary bladder cancer is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. The TNM staging system is commonly used for this purpose:

T stands for Tumor, indicating the extent of tumor invasion into the bladder wall.
N stands for Lymph Nodes, reflecting whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes and the extent of lymph node involvement.
M stands for Metastasis, indicating whether the cancer has spread to distant organs or tissues.

Based on these factors, urinary bladder cancer is categorized into four stages:
Stage 0:Cancer is limited to the inner layer of the bladder lining or consists of very early, high-grade cancer cells confined to the inner layer.
Stage 1:Cancer in the bladder's inner lining but hasn’t invaded the muscular bladder wall.
Stage 2:Cancer has invaded the bladder wall but is still confined to the bladder.
Stage 3:Cancer cells spread through the bladder wall to surrounding tissue or may involve nearby organs or lymph nodes.
Stage 4:Cancer has spread to lymph nodes and other organs like the abdominal wall, pelvic area, lymph nodes beyond the pelvis, or other organs such as bones, lungs, or liver.

Here are some of the common diagnostic measures used:
1. MEDICAL HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

1. Medical history and physical examination
A doctor will review your medical history, including any risk factors such as smoking, exposure to certain chemicals, or a family history of bladder cancer. They will also perform a physical examination to check for any signs or symptoms of bladder cancer.

2.URINALYSIS
2.Urinalysis
This involves analyzing a urine sample to check for blood in the urine (hematuria), which can be a sign of bladder cancer. Urinalysis may also detect other abnormalities such as infection or urinary stones.

3. CYSTOSCOPY
3. Cystoscopy
This is a procedure in which a thin, flexible tube with a camera (cystoscope) is inserted into the bladder through the urethra. This allows the doctor to visually examine the inside of the bladder for any abnormal growths or signs of cancer.

4. BIOPSY/TRANSURETHRAL RESECTION OF BLADDER TUMOR (TURBT)
4. Biopsy/Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT)
If abnormal tissue is detected during a cystoscopy, the doctor will perform a biopsy. It involves removing a small tissue sample for microscopic examination. This procedure, known as transurethral bladder tumor resection (TURBT), is a surgical method used to assess and treat bladder abnormalities.

5. URINE TUMOR MARKER TEST
5. Urine tumor marker test
Analyzes urine samples in the lab to detect substances produced by bladder cancer cells, aiding in the diagnosis of certain types of bladder cancer.

6. IMAGING TESTS
6. Imaging tests
Various imaging tests may be used to evaluate the bladder and surrounding structures, including:

Ultrasound:An ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the internal organs. It can help find out if the kidneys or ureters are blocked.


Computed tomography (CT) scan:Uses x-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the body, including the bladder, helping to determine the extent of cancer spread.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):Uses magnetic fields and radio waves to generate detailed pictures of the bladder.

Chest X-ray:Examines the organs and bones within the chest to check for signs of cancer spread.

Bone scan:Involves injecting a small amount of radioactive material into the bloodstream to identify potential metastasis of bladder cancer to the bones.

COMPLICATIONS OF URINARY BLADDER CANCER
Complications Of Urinary Bladder Cancer

Urinary bladder cancer can lead to various complications, some of which include:

I. TUMOR-RELATED COMPLICATIONS
I. Tumor-related complications

Weight loss:As a tumor grows, it can put extra strain on the body, making it burn more energy while also reducing appetite. This can lead to unintended weight loss.

Fatigue:Chronic inflammation and metabolic changes from tumor growth can cause severe fatigue in people with bladder cancer.


Urinary tract infections (UTIs):Tumors can disrupt normal bladder function, leading to incomplete emptying increasing the risk of recurrent UTIs.

Spread (metastasis):Bladder cancer can spread to nearby tissues and organs, such as the pelvic wall, prostate (in men), or uterus (in women). It can also metastasize to distant organs like the liver, lungs, or bones.


Ureteral obstruction:Ureters, are the two tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. Bladder tumors can block urine flow, causing retention, difficulty urinating, and potential kidney damage.

Pelvic pain:Bladder cancer can cause pain in the pelvic region, lower back, or abdomen, especially if the tumor has invaded nearby tissues or organs.


Anemia:Blood in the urine (hematuria) is a common symptom of bladder cancer. It can lead to anemia (low red blood cell count) if significant blood loss occurs over time.



II. ADVERSE EFFECTS OF SURGERY
II. Adverse effects of surgery
Urinary leak:Urine leakage from surgical sites can occur, necessitating prompt intervention to prevent complications.


Pouch stones:Urinary diversions, like continent pouches, can sometimes lead to stone formation inside the pouch, which may block urine flow or cause infections.

Erectile dysfunction:In males, surgical procedures such as radical cystectomy (removal of the bladder) can damage nerves and blood vessels involved in achieving and maintaining an erection.


Vaginal narrowing:In females, surgical procedures involving the removal of the bladder or radiation therapy can lead to scarring and narrowing of the vaginal canal, potentially affecting sexual function and comfort.
