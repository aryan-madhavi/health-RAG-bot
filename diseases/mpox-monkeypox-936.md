MPOX (MONKEYPOX)
Mpox (Monkeypox)
OVERVIEW
Overview

Mpox, previously known as Monkeypox is a viral zoonotic disease, which means that the monkeypox virus causes the disease, and the infection spreads from animals to humans.
Infection is transmitted to humans through scratches or bites from infected rodents such as rats, mice, and squirrels or by eating bush meat. Transmission of the virus can also happen from human to human but is limited to close household contacts or health care workers not wearing personal protective equipment.

Mpox was discovered in 1958 when two outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in groups of monkeys being used for research. The disease was first discovered in monkeys, hence the name monkeypox.

Mpox is commonly found in central and west Africa. Still, cases have been identified in other countries outside of central and west Africa, following travel from regions where Mpox is endemic.

This disease typically presents with fever and rash and is usually a mild and self-limiting disease. Most patients with mild cases recover without medical intervention. This information can help alleviate unnecessary fear and panic among the public.

SYMPTOMS OF MPOX
Symptoms Of Mpox

Mpox symptoms in humans, while similar to smallpox, are milder. The key symptom that sets it apart from smallpox is the enlargement or swelling of the lymph nodes. This distinction should provide some reassurance about the severity of the illness.

The time from infection to symptoms for Mpox is usually 6-13 days but can range from 5−21 days.


Predom symptoms (0-5 days):FeverHeadacheMyalgia (muscle aches)BackacheLymphadenopathyChillsMalaise (tiredness)ExhaustionSore throatDry coughDyspnea (shortness of breath)

Progression of the diseaseLesions appear within 1 to 3 days after the appearance of fever on the tongue and mouth.The patient generally develops a rash, often beginning on the face and spreading to other body parts within 24 hours.By the 4th to 5th day, the lesions become raised and filled with pus.By the end of the 2nd week, they dry up and crust. The scabs usually remain for a week before they start to fall off.

This illness typically lasts for about 2-4 weeks, and lesions progress through the following stages:Macular stage:Flat, discolored spots appear on the skin.Papular stage:The spots become raised and firm.Vesicular stage:Lesions develop into small, fluid-filled blisters.Pustular stage:The blisters fill with pus and become more pronounced.Scabbing stage:Lesions dry out, form scabs, and eventually fall off.

Remember, the severity of the skin manifestation of Mpox depends on vaccination status, age, nutrition status, and immunity status. If all the news about Mpox has you worried, remember that the symptoms are generally mild. There is no need to panic. Continue reading to get all your queries answered about Mpox.

CAUSES OF MPOX
Causes Of Mpox

Mpox is caused by the monkeypox virus that belongs to the Poxviridae family. It is generally acquired through rodents such as rats, mice, and squirrels (who are the carrier of the virus) in parts of West and Central Africa.

Any person can get Mpox by the following ways:
Bite from an infected animal or touching its blood, body fluids, spots, blisters, or scabs.
Eating meat of an infected animal from Central or West Africa that has not been cooked thoroughly.
Touching the skin or fur of the infected animals.
TRANSMISSION
Transmission
The Mpox virus mainly causes animal-to-human transmission. In rare cases, human-to-human transmission is also possible when there is close contact or large respiratory droplets.


ANIMAL-TO-HUMAN TRANSMISSION
Animal-to-human transmissionDirect physical contact with the infected blood, body fluids, skin lesions, blisters, or scabs from an infected animal.Eating the meat of an infected animal that is not cooked thoroughly.A bite or scratch from animals like rats or squirrels infected by the virus.
HUMAN-TO-HUMAN TRANSMISSION
Human-to-human transmissionClose physical contact with a person infected by Mpox virusContamination with the virus such as clothes, bedding, or towels by touchingSaliva or respiratory droplets while by coughing or sneezingThe placenta from mother to fetusMother to baby during and after childbirthUnprotected sex with an infected personMan-to-man sex

RISK FACTORS FOR MPOX
Risk Factors For Mpox

Anyone who has close physical contact with an infected animal or someone who has symptoms of Mpox is at the highest risk of developing the infection. Other people, who are at a greater risk of developing serious symptoms from Mpox include:
Newborns
Children
Immuno-deficient patients
Patients with a history of chronic illness
Healthcare workers
Laboratory professionals
DIAGNOSIS OF MPOX
Diagnosis Of Mpox

The investigation should consist of the following:
Examining the patients clinically using appropriate infection prevention and control (IPC) measures.
Questioning the patient about possible sources of infection and the presence of similar disease or symptoms in the patient’s community and contacts.
Collecting and dispatching the specimens safely for laboratory examination of Mpox.


If Mpox is suspected, health workers collect an appropriate sample and transport it safely to a laboratory with proper capability.


Samples are usually collected from a person showing symptoms, especially a traveler from a region where Mpox is endemic, an outbreak or a community(person-to-person) spread.


Asymptomatic travelers are observed for 21 days, and samples are collected once signs and symptoms appear.

The various clinical samples that can be collected to make the diagnosis are:

1. During rash phase
Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs or lesions from the roof, base scraping, fluid, and crust or scab.
Blood in specialized tubes like EDTA and SSGT
Urine in sterile container

2. During the recovery phase

Additional tests are conducted to ensure the patient has fully recovered and is no longer infectious. These tests include blood in an EDTA/SSGT tube and urine in a sterile container.
Blood in an EDTA/ SSGT tube
Urine in a sterile container

For the confirmation of Mpox on the suspected clinical specimens(Blood/ Lesion/ swabs/ urine):


a) PCR for Orthopoxvirus genus [Cowpox, Buffalopox, Camelpox, Mypox] is done.


b) If the specimen shows positivity for the Orthopoxvirus, it would be further confirmed by Mpox-specific conventional PCR or real-time PCR for Mpox DNA.


c) Additionally, virus isolation and the Next Generation Sequencing of clinical samples might be used for the characterization of the positive clinical specimens.

PREVENTION OF MPOX
Prevention Of Mpox

Mpox prevention depends on decreasing human contact with infected animals and limiting person-to-person spread. Mpox can be prevented by following these measures:


Avoid contact with infected animals, especially sick or dead ones.
Cook all foods that contain animal meat or parts thoroughly.
Avoid any kind of contact with bedding and other materials contaminated with the virus.
Maintain hygiene by washing your hands with soap and water or alcohol hand rub after coming into contact with an infected animal or person or handling their products.
Avoid close contact with an infected person.
Use personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for an infected person.
Get vaccinated.

Humans have a close connection with microorganisms. Viruses are tiny microorganisms that range in size from about 20 to 400 nanometers in diameter. Read how viruses are transmitted and ways to prevent them.

VACCINATION FOR MPOX?
Vaccination for Mpox?
JYNNEOS TM, also known as Immune or Imvanex, is a live attenuated (weakened) virus vaccine that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of mpox. However, it is not yet widely available.

Smallpox vaccines can protect against Mpox. Certain countries require timely vaccination of close contacts as post-exposure prophylaxis or for certain groups of health care workers as pre-exposure vaccination.

However, after 1980, when WHO declared that smallpox was eradicated globally, no vaccine has been manufactured in India.

Living With Mpox

With the increase in cases, the stigma around Mpox is bound to increase. Social stigma is generally a negative association between a person or group of people with certain characteristics of a specific disease. It may mean that people are labelled, stereotyped, discriminated against, treated separately, and experience loss of status because of a perceived link with a disease, especially during an outbreak. This can negatively affect the patients and their caregivers, family, and friends.

The current increase in Mpox cases and media coverage can also lead to stress and anxiety in patients and their family members. Here are some tips to deal with the psychological effects of the same:
Do not believe the experiences of others all the time
Talk about the mental health issues with healthcare professionals
Do not hide away or isolate yourself from the world
Reach out to family, friends, and life coaches for support
Get help from a therapist or psychologist if needed
Join a mental health support group if required
Understand it’s not personal

Mpox is causing similar uncertainty amongst the people as COVID-19 had caused during its inception.
