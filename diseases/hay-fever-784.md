HAY FEVER
Hay feverAlso known as Allergic rhinitis, Allergic rhinopathy Pollinosis, Rose cold, and Rose fever
OVERVIEW
Overview

Hay fever, also known as allergic rhinitis, is the body's defence system reaction to various allergens like pollen, dust mites, pet hair, mold and environmental pollutants. This reaction causes issues like sneezing, a runny or blocked nose, itchy or watery eyes, and throat or ear itching.

Hay fever affects people of all ages, but it's most prevalent in children and young adults. The chances of getting hay fever can be reduced by keeping windows closed during peak pollen seasons, using air purifiers, and regularly cleaning the home.

Over-the-counter antihistamines, nasal sprays, and decongestants may provide relief. In severe cases, an allergist can conduct tests and recommend personalized treatment plans, including allergy shots (immunotherapy), to manage hay fever effectively.

TYPES OF HAY FEVER
Types of Hay Fever

Allergic rhinitis is caused frequently by exposure to perennial or seasonal allergens that exist in our indoor and outdoor environments. On the basis of causative factors, allergic rhinitis can be classified as:

1. Allergic rhinitis (also known as seasonal hay fever):Common allergens like pollens (grass, trees, and weeds) predominantly cause seasonal allergic rhinitis.

2. Non-allergic rhinitis (also known as perennial hay fever):This type persists year-round and can result from allergens like dust mites, pet saliva or skin cells, and mold spores.

Note:One can suffer from either seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis or a combination of both.
CAUSES OF HAY FEVER
Causes Of Hay fever

Allergic reactions can occur when allergens are inhaled, ingested, or in contact with the skin. Here's how hay fever occurs:

1. Exposure to allergens:When you come into contact with allergens, such as pollen from trees, grasses, weeds, dust mites, mold spores, pet dander, or certain foods, your body recognizes them as foreign invaders.

2. Immune system response:Your immune system perceives these allergens as threats. Immune responses can be mild, from coughing and a runny nose to a life-threatening reaction known asanaphylaxis.

3. Release of chemicals:When exposed to the same allergen again, your immune system releases chemicals, including histamines, as part of the immune response. Histamines cause various allergy symptoms.

4. Allergic reaction:The release of histamines and other chemicals leads to a range of symptoms, including sneezing, runny or stuffy nose, itchy or watery eyes, coughing, and sometimes skin reactions collectively known as hay fever or allergic rhinitis.Did you know?A robust immune system can ease the symptoms of hay fever by regulating the body's reaction to allergens, minimizing their impact. Conversely, a weakened immune system might worsen allergic responses.Shop for immune boosters
RISK FACTORS FOR HAY FEVER
Risk Factors For Hay Fever

Several risk factors can increase the likelihood of developing hay fever. They include:
1. HOST FACTORS
1. Host factorsHeredity:Allergic conditions tend to run in families, indicating a strong genetic component.

Sex:Boys are more prone to hay fever, while girls show higher sensitivity to certain allergens, though these differences may change with age.

Age: Hay fever can develop at any age, but it often starts in childhood or adolescence. Exposure to allergens over time can lead to the development of allergic reactions.
Black individuals often experience more severe symptoms and higher allergy risk.

Immune system factors:An overactive or hypersensitive immune system can increase the likelihood of developing allergies like hay fever.

Medical conditions:The risk of hay fever increases in conditions likediabetes, heart disease, and respiratory disease.

2. ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
2. Environmental factorsPassive smoking:Exposure to tobacco smoke can increase the risk of hay fever or other allergic diseases including rhinitis,asthma, andeczema.

Understand how passive smoking can have other harmful effects on your body.

Environmental exposure:Living in areas with high pollen counts, especially during peak pollen seasons, can increase the risk of developing hay fever.

Dietary habits:Poor dietary choices, including low fruit and vegetable consumption, and high intake of packaged, processed and fast food, are associated with an increased risk of allergies, especially in children and adolescents.

Infections:Respiratory infections, both viral and bacterial, can influence the development of allergic sensitization and asthma in childhood.

Other allergic conditions:If you have other allergic conditions, such as asthma or eczema, you may be more prone to developing hay fever.Did you know?Research suggests that allergies like hay fever potentially increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to impaired immune responses in allergic individuals.Learn more about COVID-19
DIAGNOSIS OF HAY FEVER
Diagnosis Of Hay Fever

The diagnosis of hay fever typically involves a combination of medical history, physical examination, and sometimes additional tests. Here is an overview of the diagnostic process for hay fever:
1. MEDICAL HISTORY
1. Medical history
A doctor will start by taking a detailed medical history. They will ask about your symptoms, their duration, and any triggers that worsen or alleviate your symptoms. Be prepared to discuss when your symptoms occur, such as during specific seasons or exposure to certain allergens.

2. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
2. Physical examination
A physical examination may be conducted to assess your nasal passages, throat, and eyes. Your doctor will look for signs of inflammation, such as redness and swelling, in these areas.

3.ALLERGY TESTING
3.Allergy testing
Allergy testing is often performed to confirm the presence of hay fever to identify specific allergens responsible for your symptoms. There are three common types of allergy tests:

A. Skin prick test
It is useful in diagnosing allergies to specific substances.
During this test, small amounts of common allergens are applied to your skin, usually on your forearm or back. The skin is then lightly pricked or scratched to allow the allergens to enter the skin.
If you are allergic to a specific substance, you will develop a small raised bump or redness at the site within 15-20 minutes.

B. Allergy blood test (IgE antibody testing)
A blood test, such as a radioallergosorbent test (RAST), measures the levels of specific antibodies (IgE) in your blood.
It is done to confirm allergies to specific triggers, determine their severity, guide treatment decisions, and track progress in managing allergy symptoms.

C. Provocation test
It involves exposing the nose or eye membranes to potential allergen extracts via spray or drops. If your nose swells, you sneeze, and your nose runs, it suggests allergic rhinitis.
