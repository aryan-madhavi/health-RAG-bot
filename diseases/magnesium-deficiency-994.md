MAGNESIUM DEFICIENCY
Magnesium deficiencyAlso known as hypomagnesemia
OVERVIEW
Overview
Magnesium is an element that helps maintain normal nerve and muscle function, supports a healthy immune system, sleep and regulates the heartbeat. It also plays a pivotal role in keeping the bones healthy as well.

The human body contains around 25 g of magnesium with 90% of total body magnesium being contained in the muscles and bones. The deficiency of magnesium develops when the  blood magnesium level drops to less than 0.75 mmol/L.

Inadequate dietary intake and poor absorption due to gastrointestinal diseases are the most common causes of magnesium deficiency. The other risk factors involve a positive family history, type 2 diabetes, chronic alcoholism, and use of certain medications.

Daily consumption of foods rich in magnesium such as almonds, cashews, peanuts, spinach, pumpkin seeds, yogurt are the best way to prevent magnesium deficiency. Treatment includes magnesium supplementation. Severe magnesium deficiency might require hospitalization.

Fatigue
Weakness
Loss of appetite
Nausea
Vomiting

Magnesium depletion in the long run can cause:
Numbness
Tingling
Muscle contractions and cramps
Seizures
Abnormal heart rhythms
Abnormal eye movements

The prolonged low level of magnesium is also associated with psychological symptoms such as:
Apathy (the feeling of not being interested in or enthusiastic about anything)
Confusion
Depression
Psychosis

The severely low levels of magnesium can also cause:
Hypocalcemia (low levels of calcium)
Hypoparathyroidism
Hypokalemia (low levels of potassium)

Are you finding it difficult to fall asleep? It might be a symptom of magnesium deficiency.

CAUSES OF MAGNESIUM DEFICIENCY
Causes Of Magnesium deficiency

The possible causes of magnesium deficiency include:
Reduced consumption of magnesium
Inadequate absorption from the intestine
Excessive loss of magnesium through the kidneys (pee) or the gastrointestinal tract (stool)

These causes may be associated with many risk factors, discussed in the next section.
RISK FACTORS FOR MAGNESIUM DEFICIENCY
Risk Factors For Magnesium Deficiency
1. INADEQUATE DIETARY INTAKE

1. Inadequate dietary intake
It is one of the most important causes of magnesium deficiency. It can be attributed by
Starvation
Dieting or highly selective eating
Difficulty in swallowing
Mental illnesses
Last stage cancer
Critically ill patients who are on total i.v. nutrition


2. AGE
2. Age
The absorption of magnesium from the gut decreases with age. Older people are also more likely to have chronic diseases that can deplete magnesium levels.

3. GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS
3. Gastrointestinal disorders
Poor absorption of magnesium by the gastrointestinal tract in the following conditions can also lead to magnesium deficiency:
Celiac disease
Inflammatory bowel disease
Gastric bypass surgery
Crohn’s disease
Chronic diarrhea
Pancreatitis (swelling of the pancreas)


4. EXCESSIVE FLUID LOSS
4. Excessive fluid loss
Excessive fluid loss as a result of profuse sweating or increased urination as seen in some kidney disorders also makes one more susceptible to magnesium deficiency.


5.TYPE 2 DIABETES
5.Type 2 diabetes
Individuals with type 2 diabetes are more susceptible to magnesium deficiency due to increased excretion. It is estimated that diabetes increases the risk of magnesium deficiency by 13.5–47.7%.

6. LONG TERM ALCOHOL INTAKE
6. Long term alcohol intake
Chronic alcoholism increases the extent of magnesium deficiency to several folds. Almost 30% of people suffering from magnesium deficiency are chronic alcoholics.

7. CERTAIN MEDICATIONS
7. Certain medications
Magnesium deficiency is common in long-term consumption of certain medications like:
Loop and thiazide diuretics
Proton pump inhibitors
Aminoglycoside antibiotics
Amphotericin
Pentamidine
Digitalis
Chemotherapeutic drugs, such as cisplatin and cyclosporine


8. GENETIC DISORDERS
8. Genetic disorders
The following rare genetic conditions are also associated with magnesium deficiency:
Gitelman syndrome
Hypercalciuric hypomagnesemia
EAST (SeSAME) syndrome


9. BURNS
9. Burns
Burns that affect large areas of the body increase the risk of magnesium deficiency due to fluid loss through the burn wound.


Quick byte!
A medical condition known as hyperaldosteronism (increased secretion of aldosterone by adrenal gland) also increases the risk of magnesium deficiency. Adrenal glands are small, triangular-shaped glands located on the top of both kidneys. They produce aldosterone hormone that helps regulate salt and water in the body.
DIAGNOSIS OF MAGNESIUM DEFICIENCY
Diagnosis Of Magnesium deficiency

Magnesium deficiency can be diagnosed through a combination of clinical symptoms, medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests:
1. MEDICAL HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
