AUTISM
AutismAlso known as Autistic Disorder, Asperger Disorder, Childhood disintegrative disorder, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS)
OVERVIEW
Overview
Autism, now known as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication.

Autism is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain due to genetic conditions. Other causes are not yet known, however there are multiple risk factors that can play a role in the development of autism. The most common risk factors are nutritional deficiencies during pregnancies, age of the parents, infections, exposure to toxic chemicals and certain drugs.

Individuals with autism have difficulty in communication and adapting to social situations. They find it hard to understand what others are thinking or feeling, they get very anxious about social situations and find it hard to make friends or prefer to be on their own.

The treatment and management depends on the severity of symptoms. Though, there might be no cure for autism the goal of treatment is to maximize an individual’s ability to function by training them on social, communication, functional and behavioral skills.

TYPES OF AUTISM
Types Of Autism


In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association merged four distinct autism diagnoses into one umbrella diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). They included:

AUTISTIC DISORDER
Autistic disorder
It is also known as “classic” autism. Individuals with autistic disorder usually have significant language delays, social and communication challenges, and unusual behaviors and interests. Generally, people with autistic disorder may also have an intellectual disability.

ASPERGER SYNDROME
Asperger syndrome
This syndrome is categorized by milder symptoms of autistic disorder and the individuals might have social challenges and unusual behaviors and interests. But, they typically do not have problems with language or intellectual disability.

PERVASIVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER – NOT OTHERWISE SPECIFIED (PDD-NOS)
Pervasive developmental disorder – Not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS)
This is sometimes called “atypical autism”, and individuals who meet some of the criteria for autistic disorder or Asperger syndrome, but not all, may be diagnosed under this. These people usually have fewer and milder symptoms than those with an autistic disorder which might cause only social and communication challenges.

CHILDHOOD DISINTEGRATIVE DISORDER
Childhood disintegrative disorder
Also known as Heller's syndrome disintegrative psychosis is a rare condition characterized by developmental delays in language, social function, and motor skills after 3 years of age.

SYMPTOMS OF AUTISM
Symptoms Of Autism

Signs of autism usually appear by age 2 or 3. Some associated development delays can appear even earlier, and often, they can be diagnosed as early as 18 months. These include:
SYMPTOMS IN CHILDREN
Symptoms in children
Usually, a child with autism will present with several indicators that include:


Behavioral symptomsInexplicable tantrumsUnusual interests or attachmentsUncommon movements such as flapping hands or spinningExtreme difficulty coping with any kind of change


Sensory symptomsBeing scared of certain soundsDoes not look directly at an object or personFascinated with moving objectsHigh tolerance towards temperature and pain


Communicational symptomsNot responding to their name by 12 monthsNot giving any reactions by 12 months

SYMPTOMS IN ADULTS
Symptoms in adults
People with autism have difficulty with social communication and interaction, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors. The symptoms include:

Behavioral or interactive symptomsAvoiding eye contactInfrequently sharing interest, emotion, or enjoyment of objects or activitiesNot responding or being slow to respond to one’s name or to other verbal bids for attentionDifficulty in keeping up with the conversationsOften talking at length about a favorite subject without noticing that others are not interested or without giving others a chance to respondDisplaying varied facial expressions, movements, and gesturesHaving an unusual tone of voice that may sound sing-song or flat and robot-likeDifficulty in understanding another person’s point of viewUnable to predict or understand other people’s actionsDifficulties adjusting behaviors to social situationsDifficulties sharing in imaginative play or in making friends


Restrictive or repetitive symptomsRepeating certain behaviors or having unusual behaviorsHaving a lasting intense interest in specific topics, such as numbers, details, or factsOverly focused interest in moving objects or parts of objectsBecoming upset by slight changes in a routineBeing more sensitive towards light, sound, clothing, or temperatureExperiencing sleep problems and irritability

Note:People with autism also may have many strengths like being able to learn things in detail, having strong visual and auditory learners, and excelling in math, science, music, or arts.

CAUSES OF AUTISM
Causes Of Autism

Autism is a complex disorder and there’s no exact cause for it, however, it can develop from a combination of genetic and nongenetic, or environmental influences. These influences appear to increase the risk that a child will develop autism.
RISK FACTORS FOR AUTISM
Risk Factors For Autism

The fact that symptoms and severity vary from person to person and the complexity of this disorder, both genetics and environment may play a major role.
GENETIC RISK FACTORS
Genetic risk factors
Genetic mutation:Most individuals with autism have rare gene mutations (changes) and these mutations occur in only a single gene.
Heritability:The recurrence risk of pervasive developmental disorder in siblings of children with autism is 2% to 8%.
ENVIRONMENTAL RISK FACTORS
Environmental risk factors
Paternal age:Studies suggest that advanced paternal age was associated with an increased risk of autism that in turn is associated with gene mutations. These mutations occur with advancing age.


Environmental chemicals:Several environmental agents were identified as strong contributors to learning and developmental disabilities in humans. These include:ArsenicLeadManganeseMercuryPesticidesPolybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)Solvents


Drugs:Exposure to pharmacological agents particularly during pregnancy represents a highly relevant environmental concern relative to the risk of autism. These include:Valproic acid (VPA)ThalidomideMisoprostolBeta 2 adrenergic agonist drugsAntipyretics


Dietary factors:Diet-influenced factors are part of the potential environmental risk factors for autism that have been largely overlooked until recently. These include deficiencies of the following:Vitamin D:Somestudieshave found that mothers of autistic children versus those with non-autistic children have reduced serum vitamin D levels.Folic acid:Folate availability has also been suggested as a possible factor in the risk of autism because of its role in affecting neurodevelopment.


Infections:The idea that maternal and/or early infant infections could influence neurodevelopment and contribute to adverse outcomes.


Assisted reproductive technologies (ART):Children conceived using ART were more likely to be diagnosed with autism than those conceived naturally.


Pregnancy-related factors:Studies demonstrate that certain prenatal factors that aid in the development of autism include:Maternal asthmaAllergic conditionsMaternal toxemia or bleedingPrenatal stressorsBeginning of prenatal careUrbanization of birthplacePregnancy and birth complications like extreme prematurity, low birth weight, multiple pregnanciesPregnancies spaced with less than a one-year gap

DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM
Diagnosis Of Autism

Evaluation of autism begins with a screening of the general pediatric population to identify children at-risk or demonstrating signs suggestive of autism, after which a thorough diagnostic evaluation needs to be done.

A parent interview, collection of any outside informant observations, and direct clinician observation of the child’s current cognitive, language, and adaptive functioning by a clinician experienced with autism should be components of this comprehensive assessment. Further, diagnostic evaluation include:
COMPLETE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Complete physical examination
Individuals with autism often have a number of unusual physical characteristics, which can be evaluated by the following:

Assessment for dysmorphic features:Dysmorphology is the study of the atypical development of physical features which include birth defects like presence or absence of ear pit.
Full neurologic examination with head circumference:Individuals with autism often show a high level of anxiety and are frequently affected by comorbidities that influence their quality of life. Also, studies demonstrate children with autism often exhibit an atypical trajectory of head circumference (HC) growth, which may be an indicator of vulnerability to autism.
Wood’s lamp examination of the skin:This test is often used to make a diagnosis of specific skin and hair disorders.
GENETIC TESTING
Genetic testing
Currently, no clear biomarkers or diagnostic measures exist for autism, and the diagnosis is made based on the fulfillment of descriptive criteria. Given a relatively high yield in patients with autism, clinical genetic testing is recommended. It can provide information regarding medical interventions or work that might be necessary and help with family planning.

Note:Children with autism should also be screened for other illnesses or learning disorders, the comprehensive evaluation may include blood tests and hearing tests. Get tests in the comfort of your home.

She was diagnosed with autism as a child. Though she was extremely shy around other people and very fearful of the spotlight as an adult, her special interests in watching movies supported her career as an actress.
PREVENTION OF AUTISM
Prevention Of Autism

There's no way to prevent autism, however, certain measures taken during pregnancy along with early detection and screening can reduce the impact to a greater level. These include:
GET GENETIC TESTING DONE
Get genetic testing done
Genes represent the baseline susceptibility, which results in physiological changes that overcome the individual’s resilience and adaptation. Manipulation of these factors can render some kind of prevention.

Protect yourself from air pollution
Air and chemical pollution are also a matter of general public health that have an effect on the development of autism in children whose mothers are exposed to it.
AVOID HIGH THERMAL-INTENSITY ULTRASOUND

Avoid high thermal-intensity ultrasound
Studies suggest that the use of modern high thermal-intensity ultrasound in the first trimester of pregnancy increased the risk of autism. Since the toxic window covers the first trimester, avoidance or reasoned use of ultrasound during this period may decrease the overall risk for autism.
EAT HEALTHY

Eat healthy
Nutritional deficiencies are a known risk factor for the development of autism. Make sure to get enough Vitamin D and folic acid during pregnancy.
ADD MULTIVITAMINS TO YOUR REGIME

DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION (DBS)
Deep brain stimulation (DBS)
DBS has been used to send electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain [and provides a therapeutic benefit. Certain studies have demonstrated the efficacy of DBS for psychiatric disorders including refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, Tourette syndrome, and others in the past few years and have shown some good results in individuals with autism.
MEDICATIONS

Medications
Antidepressants were the most commonly used agents followed by stimulants and antipsychotics. Antipsychotics were effective in treating repetitive behaviors in children with autism. Alternative options include opiate antagonists, immunotherapy, hormonal agents, megavitamins, and other dietary supplements.
BEHAVIORAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPIES

Behavioral and psychological therapies
Individuals with autism may be referred to specialists who provide behavioral, psychological, educational, or skill-building interventions. These programs may help people with autism in managing their behavior as these are highly structured and intensive therapies that also involve caregivers, siblings, and other family members.
OTHER INTERVENTIONS

Other interventions
While there is no "cure" for autism, there are several effective interventions that can improve a child's functioning. Those include:

Training for social skills: This training is done in groups and the children with autism are taught to navigate through social situations.
Therapy to improve communication: These therapies are focused to improve the child's speech patterns and understanding of language.
Training for parents: In this, the parents are shown effective ways of responding to problematic behavior and encouraging appropriate behavior in their child.
Occupational therapy: This type of therapy addresses adaptive skills and helps individuals with activities of daily living, as well as problems with handwriting.
Special education services: This includes special day classes for very young children to address language, social, and life skills.


TREATING OTHER CONDITIONS

MANAGE SOCIAL ANXIETY
Manage social anxiety
For individuals with autism, social anxiety can act as a trigger. It can be hard to know if a person with autism is experiencing anxiety. Always stay alert to signs that your loved one with autism is not behaving in a way that is normal for him or her.
MAINTAIN PERSONAL SPACE AND BOUNDARIES

Maintain personal space and boundaries
If you’re caring for a child with autism, and your child is sick, bringing in a doctor who might not understand the personal boundaries can be a trigger and can also lead to the unintentional spread of germs. The best way to prevent this from happening is to rely on in-home treatment instead.
SUPERVISE GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS

Supervise gastrointestinal disorders
Another common ailment in children with autism is a gastrointestinal disorder which can include chronic diarrhea and constipation. Make sure to give in-home careers so it can eliminate the risk of an accident or uncomfortable situation.
BE VIGILANT IN CASE OF EMERGENCY

Be vigilant in case of emergency
Seizure disorders and epilepsy are frequently reported medical comorbidities in individuals with autism. In-home treatment is a top choice for someone experiencing a mild seizure, but if the symptoms include involuntary stiffening or jerking of muscles, confusion, loss of consciousness, call an ambulance or visit your doctor immediately.
TIPS FOR PARENTS

Tips for Parents
Having a child with autism affects the whole family and it can be stressful, time-consuming and expensive. Paying attention to the physical and emotional health of the whole family is important.
