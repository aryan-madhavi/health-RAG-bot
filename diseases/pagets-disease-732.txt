PAGET'S DISEASE
Paget's diseaseAlso Known as Osteitis deformans.
OVERVIEW
Overview
Paget's disease of bone is a chronic condition characterized by abnormal bone remodeling, leading to weakened and deformed bones. It commonly affects older adults, with a prevalence increasing with age, though the exact cause remains unclear. Paget's disease primarily involves localized areas of bones, often affecting the pelvis, spine, skull, and long bones of the legs.

Symptoms can vary widely from mild to severe, including bone pain, deformities, fractures, and in rare cases, neurological complications due to compression of nerves. Diagnosis typically involves imaging studies like X-rays and bone scans, along with blood tests to assess bone turnover markers.

Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. Medications such as bisphosphonates are commonly prescribed to slow bone turnover and reduce pain. Physical therapy may also help maintain mobility and reduce the risk of fractures.

In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to stabilize bones or replace joints. With appropriate management, many individuals with Paget's disease can lead active lives and minimize the impact of the condition on their daily activities.

SYMPTOMS OF PAGET’S DISEASE
Symptoms Of Paget’s Disease

Paget's disease of bone often manifests with bone or joint pain and nerve compression symptoms but can be asymptomatic and detected incidentally.


Commonly Affected Areas and Symptoms:

1. PelvisHip painJoint pain, stiffness, and swellingMovement loss, numbness, tinglingBalancing problems

2. SkullHearing lossHeadaches

3. LegBone bending, enlargement, and deformitiesPain, osteoarthritis in knee/hipWarmth over the affected bone

4. Spine
Pain, and tingling in arms and legs due to nerve compression


Note:Advanced stages of the disease may exhibit additional bone changes, such as increased head size, limb bowing, or spinal curvature. Rarely, Paget's disease can progress to bone cancer.

Partial loss of limb movement or loss of bowel/bladder control requires prompt consultation with a doctor.

TYPES OF PAGET’S DISEASE
Types Of Paget’s Disease

There are several types of Paget's disease that are not related to Paget's disease of the bone. These include:

Paget's disease of the nipple or breast:This rare condition is associated with breast cancer. It starts on the nipple and can spread to the areola.


Paget's disease of the penis:It is an extremely rare form of penile cancer.


Paget's disease of the vulva:This is a rare skin disease that occurs on the female external genitals, typically appearing after menopause and spreading slowly.
CAUSES OF PAGET’S DISEASE
Causes Of Paget’s Disease

Throughout life, the body undergoes a continuous process of removing old bone and replacing it with new bone, similar to how dead skin is shed and replaced. This natural cycle is called bone remodelling.

The key cells involved in this process are:

Osteoclasts:Cells responsible for breaking down old bone.
Osteoblasts:Cells responsible for forming new bone.


In Paget's disease of bone, there is an imbalance where new bone forms faster than old bone is removed. This results in larger, weaker, and sometimes misshapen bones. The cause lies in overactive osteoclasts that absorb bone too quickly, coupled with osteoblasts producing new bone that is larger but weaker than normal.
RISK FACTORS FOR PAGET’S DISEASE
Risk Factors For Paget’s Disease

Factors that can increase the risk of Paget's disease include:

1. Age:People older than 40 are most likely to develop Paget’s disease.

2. Sex:Men are slightly more commonly affected than women. The reason behind this is not clear.

3. Genetics:An individual is more likely to develop it if you have a family history of Paget’s disease.
DIAGNOSIS OF PAGET’S DISEASE
Diagnosis Of Paget’s Disease

The diagnosis usually involves evaluating the patient's medical history, conducting a physical examination, blood tests, and imaging tests.

1. MEDICAL HISTORY
1. Medical History
The doctor will ask the patient and possibly a family member or friend questions to gather information about the patient's overall health, family history of Paget's disease, past medical issues, and ability to carry out daily activities.

2. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
2. Physical examination
The doctor will examine the areas of the body that are causing the patient pain.

3. BLOOD TESTS
3. Blood tests
Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP):A simple blood test can check the level of ALP in your blood. Elevated ALP levels may indicate Paget’s disease or another condition, such as liver disease. People with Paget's disease of bone often exhibit elevated ALP levels.

Book Test Here
4. IMAGING TESTS

4. Imaging tests
X-rays:This test can show whether the bones have become enlarged as a result of Paget's disease of bone.
Bone scan:Also known as scintigraphy can be done to assess the extent of the condition in the body. For this procedure, a small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into the blood, which collects in areas of active bone renewal.

5. FURTHER TESTS
5. Further tests
Further tests are usually required if an individual has signs of more severe Paget's disease of bone or the doctor thinks there's a chance of bone cancer (although this is very rare).

Bone biopsy:During this procedure a sample of bone is removed from the body to be looked at under a microscope.

Computerized tomography (CT) scan: A series of X-rays of the affected bone are taken to create a detailed 3-dimensional image of the affected bone.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan:An MRI scan is a noninvasive medical imaging test that utilizes a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the affected bone.
PREVENTION OF PAGET’S DISEASE
Prevention Of Paget’s Disease

2. SURGERY (IF NECESSARY)

2. Surgery (if necessary)
Surgery may become necessary despite the medication's ability to manage bone growth and reduce complications. It's often required to address issues resulting from Paget’s disease complications, including:
Fractures:Surgery can facilitate the healing of fractures, ensuring they mend correctly.
Arthritis:Severe bone changes may necessitate hip or knee replacement surgery to manage disability.
Misshapen Bones:Surgical intervention involves cutting and realigning affected bones, particularly in weight-bearing joints, to alleviate pain.

Surgical procedures may include:

1. Internal fixation:Repositions bone fragments and secures them with screws, wires, pins, or metal plates to stabilize fractures.


2. Osteotomy:Relieves pain and restores alignment in weight-bearing joints like the knee and hip by removing a wedge of bone near the damaged joint to redistribute weight onto healthier areas.
COMPLICATIONS OF PAGET’S DISEASE
Complications Of Paget’s Disease

Paget's disease typically progresses slowly and can be effectively managed in most cases. However, complications can arise, including:

1. BONE AND JOINT ISSUES
1. Bone and Joint issues
Osteoarthritis:Degenerative joint disease caused by the stress of affected bones on nearby joints.
Broken bones:Bones affected by Paget's disease are fragile and more prone to fractures even with minor injuries.
Bone deformities:Enlarged or misshapen bones, bowed legs (bowlegs), and curved spine (scoliosis) can occur.
Osteopetrosis:Abnormal bone remodeling leading to weakened, enlarged, and misshapen bones.

2. HEARING LOSS
2. Hearing loss
Damage to bones or nerves linking ears to the brain can result in permanent hearing loss if the skull is affected.
3. OTHER COMPLICATIONS

3. Other complicationsHypercalcemia:Increased bone renewal cycle in Paget's disease can cause excess calcium in the blood in some cases.

Heart failure:Strain on the heart from extra blood vessels in newly formed bone can potentially lead to heart failure.

Bone cancer:A rare complication affecting about 1% of people with Paget's disease.

Vertigo:Sensation of spinning or dizziness; compression of skull bones around the inner ear can cause vertigo.

Tinnitus:Ringing, buzzing, or other noises in the ears; compression of skull bones near the inner ear can lead to tinnitus symptoms.
