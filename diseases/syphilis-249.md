SYPHILIS
SyphilisAlso known as Lues, Lues venerea, Pox, and Syph
OVERVIEW
Overview
Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacteria Treponema pallidum.

It progresses through three stages. In the primary stage, a small, painless sore called a chancre appears at the site of infection, usually within 10 days to 3 months after exposure. In the secondary stage, the chancre disappears, and a rash appears, often starting on the trunk and spreading across the body. If untreated, syphilis can advance to the tertiary stage, causing severe health issues like heart disease, blindness, or paralysis.

Syphilis can be prevented by practicing safe sex, limiting sexual partners, and promoting sexual health education.

It is treatable with antibiotics, typically Penicillin G, but for those allergic to penicillin, alternatives like doxycycline, tetracycline, or ceftriaxone are available. Early detection and treatment are crucial to prevent serious complications.

SYMPTOMS OF SYPHILIS
Symptoms Of Syphilis

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that affects both men and women. It can often go unnoticed for a while, and people may unknowingly spread it to others.
The symptoms of syphilis change over time and appear in three stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary.
PRIMARY SYPHILIS
Primary Syphilis
The first symptoms usually show up 2 to 6 weeks after exposure.
The most common sign is a small, painless sore called a chancre.This sore typically appears on the genitals, anus, or mouth, and is easy to overlook since it’s painless.
Swollen lymph nodes, particularly in the groin, often accompany the chancre.
These sores usually heal on their own in 2 to 6 weeks, but the lymph nodes may stay swollen for longer.
Without treatment, syphilis progresses to the next stage.


SECONDARY SYPHILIS
Secondary Syphilis
A few weeks after the chancre heals, symptoms of secondary syphilis may appear.
These include a red, blotchy rash that often appears on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, along with white patches in the mouth.
Other common symptoms are swollen glands, headache, fatigue, fever, and muscle aches. In some cases, hair loss may occur.

Note:Because syphilis symptoms can be vague and similar to other conditions, people may overlook them. This is why syphilis is often called the "great imitator."


LATENT SYPHILIS
Latent Syphilis
After the secondary stage, syphilis may enter a latent phase, where no symptoms are present, but the infection is still in the body.
During the early latent phase (within the first year), the infection can be passed on to others through sexual contact.
After a year or more, the infection is no longer contagious, but it can still progress to the final stage.


TERTIARY SYPHILIS
Tertiary Syphilis
If left untreated, syphilis can develop into tertiary syphilis years later.
This stage can cause serious damage to the body, affecting the brain, nerves, eyes, and heart.
Symptoms may include vision problems, dementia, difficulty with coordination, and heart disease.
While syphilis can still be treated at this stage, the damage caused by tertiary syphilis cannot be reversed.Did you know?
Babies born to mothers who have syphilis can be infected during pregnancy or at birth. While many infants with congenital syphilis show no symptoms at birth, some may develop a rash on the palms of their hands and the soles of their feet. If untreated, later signs of congenital syphilis may include deafness, teeth deformities, and saddle noses.
CAUSES OF SYPHILIS
Causes Of Syphilis

Syphilis is caused by a bacterium called Treponema pallidum. This bacterium is the primary cause of the infection, and it spreads through various transmission routes, primarily involving direct contact with an infected person. Here’s a breakdown of the causes:


Sexual contact:The most common cause of syphilis is unprotected sexual contact with an infected person, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex.


Direct contact with an infected lesion:Syphilis can also be transmitted by coming into direct contact with the sores or lesions of an infected person, even without sexual intercourse.


Mother to child (congenital syphilis):An infected mother can pass syphilis to her baby during pregnancy or childbirth, leading to congenital syphilis.


Blood transfusion:In rare cases, syphilis can be transmitted through infected blood, though this is uncommon due to blood screening processes.


Organ transplants:Though rare, syphilis can be transmitted through infected organs during an organ transplant.
RISK FACTORS FOR SYPHILIS
Risk Factors For Syphilis

Here are the key risk factors for syphilis:
Unprotected sexual activity:The most significant risk factor is engaging in unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex with an infected person.


Multiple sexual partners:Having multiple sexual partners increases the likelihood of exposure to syphilis and other STIs.


Men who have sexual contact with other men:They are at higher risk due to higher rates of syphilis transmission in this group.


Previous STI infections:Having a history of other sexually transmitted infections increases the likelihood of contracting syphilis.


HIV infection:People with HIV are at greater risk for syphilis due to compromised immune systems, which can make the body more susceptible to infections.


Pregnancy:Pregnant women who are not screened or treated for syphilis may transmit the infection to their baby, leading to congenital syphilis.
DIAGNOSIS OF SYPHILIS
Diagnosis Of Syphilis

The diagnosis of syphilis typically involves a combination of physical exams, lab tests, and patient history. Here's an overview of how syphilis is diagnosed:

1. PHYSICAL EXAM
1. Physical exam
A healthcare provider will check for visible signs of syphilis, such as painless sores (chancres) or rashes. For men, the doctor examines the penis, foreskin, and urethra; for women, an internal vaginal exam is performed. Lymph nodes and other areas of the body may also be checked for abnormalities.

2. DIRECT TESTING OF A CHANCRE
2. Direct testing of a chancre
It typically involves taking a sample from the sore to detect the presence of Treponema pallidum, the bacterium that causes syphilis. The process includes:
Microscopic examination:A healthcare provider may use a microscope to examine a sample from the chancre. The sample is usually obtained by gently scraping the ulcer. If the bacterium is present, it can be seen under the microscope.


Darkfield microscopy: This is a special technique used to view the bacteria from the chancre directly. It is highly effective in detecting T. pallidum from active lesions.


Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR):In some cases, PCR testing may be used to amplify and detect the DNA of T. pallidum from the lesion. This method is not commonly used in routine diagnosis but may be used in specific cases.


Note:These tests allow for a direct diagnosis of syphilis in the early stages, even before blood tests become effective
3. BLOOD TESTS

3. Blood Tests
Blood tests are the most common method for diagnosing syphilis. Two types of tests are typically used:


Nontreponemal tests:These tests detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the syphilis infection, such as the Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) tests. These tests can indicate if syphilis is present but may produce false positives due to other conditions.

Treponemal tests:These tests specifically detect antibodies to the Treponema pallidum bacteria, such as the TP-PA (T. pallidum particle agglutination) test or FTA-ABS (Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption) test. These are more specific to syphilis.

4. LUMBAR PUNCTURE (FOR NEUROSYPHILIS)
4. Lumbar Puncture (for neurosyphilis)
In cases where syphilis may have affected the nervous system (neurosyphilis), a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) may be performed to analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for evidence of infection.


5. PREGNANCY SCREENING
5. Pregnancy screening
Pregnant women are routinely screened for syphilis to prevent congenital syphilis transmission to the baby.

Note:If you're sexually active or have been in contact with someone infected, it's important to get tested.

PREVENTION OF SYPHILIS
Prevention Of Syphilis

There is no vaccine for syphilis. However, to prevent the spread of syphilis following measures can be adopted. They are:
Practice safe sex:Use condoms during sexual contact. While not 100% effective, they significantly reduce the risk of syphilis and other STIs.


Limit sexual partners:Being in a mutually monogamous relationship lowers the risk of exposure to syphilis and other STIs.


Get regular screenings:If you’re sexually active, regular STI testing is important for early detection and prevention.


Avoid sexual contact with infected individuals: If you or your partner has syphilis or any other STI, avoid sexual contact until treatment is complete and the infection is no longer contagious.


Prompt treatment of infected partners:If diagnosed with syphilis, ensure that both you and your partner receive treatment to prevent further transmission.


Education and awareness:Educating yourself and your sexual partners about syphilis, its symptoms, and how it’s transmitted helps in reducing its spread.


Pregnancy screening:Pregnant women should get tested for syphilis to avoid passing the infection to their babies during pregnancy or childbirth.

Note:Condoms are key in preventing syphilis and other STIs by blocking contact with infected areas and reducing transmission risks.

SPECIALIST TO VISIT
Specialist To Visit

If a person develops symptoms like rashes, or sores on the moist areas like genitals, mouth, throat, or anus then that person should visit a doctor and confirm the presence of syphilis or any other infection. The doctors to visit are:

General physician
Dermatologist
Obstetrician-Gynecologist (OB-GYN)
Urologist
Infectious disease specialist

Ageneral physiciancan diagnose and treat syphilis, or refer you to a specialist if needed.


If you have skin symptoms, such as sores or rashes, adermatologistcan help diagnose and treat syphilis.


Sexually active women can visit anOB-GYNfor testing and treatment of syphilis, especially if pregnant.


Men with genital symptoms like sores or unusual discharge may consult aurologistfor diagnosis and treatment.


For complicated or advanced syphilis cases, aninfectious disease specialistmay be consulted.


Note:Syphilis is a curable disease. However, early treatment is the key because if left ignored, the bacteria can cause irreparable damage.

So do not ignore its symptoms and seek advice from a doctor at the right time.

TREATMENT OF SYPHILIS
Treatment Of Syphilis

Syphilis is effectively treated with antibiotics, and the specific treatment depends on the stage of the infection. The goal of treatment is to cure the infection, prevent complications, and avoid spreading it to others. Here's a more detailed breakdown of syphilis treatment:


1. Penicillin:The preferred treatment for syphilis isBenzathine Penicillin Gusually administered as an injection. It effectively cures syphilis at any stage, including latent syphilis.


2. Other Antibiotics:For people allergic to penicillin, other antibiotics may be used:


Doxycycline(oral):This is typically used for those who are allergic to penicillin but not for pregnant women.


Tetracycline(oral):Another alternative for penicillin-allergic individuals.


Ceftriaxone(injection):An alternative for those who cannot take penicillin. This may be used for patients who cannot tolerate doxycycline or tetracycline.


Penicillin Desensitization:For those with a severe penicillin allergy, penicillin desensitization is a process where the patient is gradually given small doses of penicillin until they can tolerate the full dose. This is typically done in a controlled medical setting.

Note: It's important to complete the full course of antibiotics, even if symptoms improve, and to avoid sexual contact until treatment is completed and the infection is cleared. Early treatment can prevent serious complications and transmission to others.

TREATMENT IN SPECIAL CASES

Treatment in Special Cases
Pregnancy:Benzathine Penicillin is safe and recommended for pregnant women with syphilis. It’s the only treatment proven to prevent transmission to the baby. Other antibiotics like doxycycline are not recommended during pregnancy, as they can harm the fetus.

Congenital Syphilis:For infants born with syphilis, IV penicillin G is the treatment of choice. Early treatment is critical to prevent severe complications, including developmental delays, deafness, or organ damage.

Neurosyphilis:If syphilis has progressed to affect the nervous system (neurosyphilis), intravenous (IV) penicillin G is required. Neurosyphilis can occur at any stage but is most common in late-stage or untreated syphilis.

COMPLICATIONS OF SYPHILIS
Complications Of Syphilis

If left untreated, syphilis can lead to severe complications that affect multiple organs in the body. The complications of syphilis vary depending on the stage of the infection. Here’s a breakdown of potential complications at each stage:
1. PRIMARY STAGE COMPLICATIONS
1. Primary stage complications
Spread of Infection: If not treated, syphilis can move to the secondary stage. The chancre (painful sore) might also cause discomfort or become infected with other bacteria if not properly cared for.


2. SECONDARY STAGE COMPLICATIONS
2. Secondary stage complications
Neurological impact:The rash and other symptoms can sometimes indicate an early stage of syphilis affecting the nervous system, potentially leading to more serious complications if untreated.
Hair loss:Alopecia (hair loss) can occur, especially on the scalp, eyebrows, or beard.
Increased risk of HIV:Untreated syphilis increases the risk of contracting or transmitting HIV due to the sores and rashes on the skin and mucous membranes.
Oral and genital lesions:The rash may cause ulcerations in the mouth, genital area, or anus, leading to discomfort and difficulty eating or engaging in sexual activities.


3. LATENT STAGE COMPLICATIONS
3. Latent stage complications
Transmission risk:While there are no symptoms, the infection remains in the body and can still be transmitted to others, especially during the first year of the latent phase.


Psychological impact:The absence of symptoms during the latent phase may lead individuals to unknowingly spread the infection, impacting relationships and increasing the stigma around STIs.


4. TERTIARY STAGE COMPLICATIONS (LATE-STAGE SYPHILIS)
4. Tertiary stage complications (Late-stage syphilis)
If syphilis remains untreated for years, it can progress to the tertiary stage, where severe complications can develop, including:

Cardiovascular syphilis:Syphilis can damage the heart and blood vessels, which can be life-threatening if not treated.

Neurosyphilis:This affects the nervous system and can cause:Dementia and cognitive declineStrokeVision problems or blindnessMemory lossCoordination problems, like difficulty walking or balancingMeningitis (inflammation of the brain membranes)Paralysis


Gummatous syphilis:Soft, tumor-like growths called gummas can form on the skin, bones, liver, and other organs. These can cause significant tissue damage and require surgical removal in some cases.


5. CONGENITAL SYPHILIS (IN NEWBORNS)
5. Congenital syphilis (In newborns)Premature birth or stillbirthDeafness, blindness, or developmental delaysSaddle nose (collapse of the nose bridge)Hutchinson teeth (notched, peg-shaped teeth)Bone deformitiesRashes on the palms of hands and soles of feetNeurological complications- These include brain damage, seizures, or developmental disabilities.Did our information help you?In our relentless endeavour to keep improving our services, you are our eyes.
