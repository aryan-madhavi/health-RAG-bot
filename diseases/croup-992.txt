CROUP
CroupAlso known as laryngotracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis and laryngotracheal bronchopneumonitis
OVERVIEW
Overview
Croup is a respiratory illness that primarily affects the voice box, windpipe and upper airways of children under 5 years of age. The condition is mostly caused by viruses and rarely by bacteria.

The most characteristic symptoms are ‘barking cough’ and ‘stridor’ characterized by high-pitched whistling noise while breathing. Other symptoms includesore throat, runny nose,hoarseness of voice and fever.

Most of the cases of croup are mild and resolve within a few days with symptomatic care. Children with severe symptoms may need steroids,epinephrine, and supplemental oxygen. Careful monitoring of heart rate along with respiration is also critical in such cases.

SYMPTOMS OF CROUP
Symptoms Of Croup

Cough that sounds like a barking seal
Stridor (an abnormal, high-pitched, harsh, raspy sound during inspiration)
Hoarseness of voice
Sore throat
Runny nose
Fever (100-103 F)
Difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath
Congestion
Difficulty in swallowing
Increase in respiratory rate
Increase in heart rate
Nasal flaring (widening of nostrils while breathing)

The symptoms of croup usually become worse at night.

In some cases, children may also experience:
Cyanosis - a condition in which skin, lips or nails turn blue.
Skin rashes
Conjunctivitis
Dehydration
The symptoms of croup last for within 4-7 days, but can prolong for as long as 2 weeks.
Interesting facts!
The name “croup” is derived from the word “kropan” which refers to crying out in a hoarse voice.
The sound, called "stridor," has been noted to resemble the breathing of the Star Wars character Darth Vader.
CAUSES OF CROUP
Causes Of Croup

Croup is majorly a viral infection though some bacteria are also reported to cause it. The various causes are discussed as follows:
1. VIRUS
1. Virus
The common viruses that can cause croup include:
Parainfluenza virus
Influenza A and B
Measles
Adenovirus
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
Here are 4 habits that should be followed to prevent viral infections.
Tap to Know

2. BACTERIA
2. Bacteria
Croup mostly begin as viral infection which later becomes complicated due to secondary growth  of bacteria like:
Corynebacterium diphtheriae
Staphylococcus aureus
Streptococcus pneumoniae
Hemophilus influenzae
Moraxella catarrhalis
WHAT DO THESE VIRUSES AND BACTERIA DO?
What do these viruses and bacteria do?
These bacteria and viruses cause swelling of the larynx (sound box), trachea (windpipe) and large airways. The swelling causes partial obstruction of the airway which leads to difficulty in breathing and the other characteristic symptoms of croup.
HOW DOES THE INFECTION SPREAD?
How does the infection spread?
Viral croup can be spread through coughing, sneezing, and other respiratory secretions such as droplets and mucus from coughing. Children can catch croup through:
Contact with the virus in the air after an infected person has coughed or sneezed
Handling infected person
Touching contaminated surfaces
Children with croup are contagious for at least 3 days after the infection.
TYPES OF CROUP
Types Of Croup

The type of the croup depends upon the level of difficulty faced by the children to pull air into lungs. The size of the windpipe and the degree of its narrowing determines its severity. Based upon the severity of croup, it can be divided into three types:
1. MILD
1. Mild
Children with mild croup do not generally have symptoms at rest. Children may experience stress but not at rest. The high pitched noisy breathing is usually felt when the child cries or coughs.

2. MODERATE
2. Moderate
Children with moderate croup may be slightly disoriented or agitated, and may have moderate difficulty breathing.
3. SEVERE
3. Severe
Croup is considered severe if the symptoms such as stridor and difficulty in breathing are experienced by the individual even at rest.
The presence of retractions –  inward movement (sucking in) of the sternum (breast bone) or skin between the ribs as the child struggles to take a breath is a characteristic sign of severe croup.

Note:Approximately 85% of cases of croup are mild and less than 1% are considered severe.

Quick byte!
There is one more rare form of croup known as spasmodic croup. It occurs suddenly, often in the middle of the night, making the child wake up suddenly gasping for breath, with a hoarse voice, and stridor while breathing in. It occurs in the absence of any viral infection. It is believed to be caused by inflammation caused by allergies from pollen, bee sting etc or reflux from a child's stomach.

RISK FACTORS FOR CROUP
Risk Factors For Croup

1. AGE
1. Age
Almost all of the cases of croup are seen in children between the age group of 3 months to 5 years due to the small diameter of the windpipe.


2. SEASON
2. Season
Children are more likely to develop croup during late autumn or early winter due to occurrence of more viruses, such as colds and flu at this time of year.

Protect your child this winter season.

LOW IMMUNITY
Low immunity
Children with low immunity are more prone to bacterial, viral infections that can cause croup.
DIAGNOSIS OF CROUP
Diagnosis Of Croup

Croup is majorly diagnosed with its clinical symptoms and physical findings.
The doctor may listen to your child's breathing with a stethoscope for wheezing and decreased breath sounds. Visual examination of the throat may reveal redness in the upper airway.
The following tests can be performed as per the need of the situation:
1. COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT
1. Complete blood count
Blood tests do not confirm croup but give an indication of the disease. Complete blood count (CBC) is used to assess the infection. The white blood cell count of the CBC may suggest the presence of a virus.
2. PULSE OXIMETRY
2. Pulse oximetry
It is used to measure oxygen level of the blood. This is usually done by placing a clip-like device called a probe on a body part, such as a finger or ear lobe.
This monitoring is helpful in assessing the need for supplemental oxygen.

Keep a pulse oximetry at your home for a better assessment of oxygen level.

3. LARYNGOSCOPY
3. Laryngoscopy
It involves examination of the voice box and vocal cords using a camera. It is not used for routine examinations. The circumstances in which this examination is used include:
Failure of other diagnostic methods
Presence of acute distress in child
Confirmation of bacterial tracheitis (complication of croup)
4.NECK X-RAY
4.Neck X-ray
The X-ray of the neck can also be considered for observing features like tapering of the upper windpipe or thickened trachea. However, it is not routinely used.

PREVENTION OF CROUP
Prevention Of Croup


1. PRACTICE HAND HYGIENE
1. Practice hand hygiene
Most cases of viral croup can be prevented by washing hands with soap and water for at least 30 seconds both for the child as well as the parents:
After going to the toilet
Before and after eating food
After handling vomiting of an infected patient
After changing the diapers of the child.
Buy sanitizers and hand wash from the comfort of your home.

2. MAINTAIN HYGIENE
2. Maintain hygiene
Bacterial croup spreads through contaminated surfaces. Practicing good hygiene is the best way to prevent infection. The following measures can be taken to ensure the cleanliness:
Keep the nails short and avoid wearing false fingernails, nail extenders and nail polish, and jewelry as they restrict adequate cleaning of hands.
Clean the surfaces or objects that have been exposed to vomits or feces.
Wear disposable gloves and masks while handling feces or vomit of infected individuals.
Use disposable paper towels to dry your hands. Clothes towels should be avoided as bacteria can survive on objects.
Keep kitchen tops, toys, toilet seats, nappy change tables clean to avoid the growth of bacteria and viruses.
3. ISOLATE THE PATIENT
3. Isolate the patient
As croup is highly contagious, isolation of the patient prevents the spread of the infection.
Children who have experienced symptoms such as stridor (an abnormal, high-pitched, musical breathing sound), hoarseness, rhinorrhea (runny nose), and sore throat should not return to childcare until 24 hours after symptoms have resolved.


4. ENSURE VACCINATION
4. Ensure vaccination
Croup is caused by several viruses and bacteria. Some of the viral infections causing croup such as influenza can be prevented by ensuring proper vaccination.

Here are lesser vaccines that can benefit your child.

TREATMENT OF CROUP
Treatment Of Croup

The treatment of croup generally depends upon the severity of the condition.
Antibiotics are usually ineffective as the condition is majorly caused by viruses.
There is no proven role of cough medicines and decongestants.


The medications used in managing symptoms include:
1. SALTWATER NOSE DROPS
1. Saltwater nose drops
This is an excellent remedy for symptomatic relief. The salt water nose drops help in losing the mucus and clears the airways.
2. NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDS)
2. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
These drugs are used to control fever. The common examples includeparacetamolandibuprofen.
3. STEROIDS
3. Steroids
Steroids work by decreasing swelling of the larynx due to its antiinflammatory action. They can be given intravenously (IV), intramuscularly (IM), or orally (PO) depending upon the condition. Examples include:
Dexamethasone
Prednisolone
Budesonide
4. EPINEPHRINE (ADRENALINE)
4. Epinephrine (adrenaline)
This drug is given by nebulizer (through inhalation) to the children. It works by dilating the muscles of the airway. This increases the supply of oxygen which helps in managing symptoms. The effect with epinephrine is very immediate (usually within the first 30 minutes) of administration.
5. OXYGEN
5. Oxygen
Children with severe croup may need supplemental oxygen. It is administered through a mask or nasal cannula.
6. INTUBATION
6. Intubation
It involves insertion of a tube into the trachea (windpipe) for respiratory support. It is used in children with life threatening symptoms experienced by the child due to narrowing of airway as a result of excessive swelling.
7. HELIOX
7. Heliox
It is a mixture of oxygen and helium that is usually delivered to the individual through a nasal cannula and face mask. It is used if the children are facing excessive difficulty in breathing.
Helium aids in the movement of oxygen and decreases the load of respiratory muscles.
8. ANTIBIOTICS
8. Antibiotics
They are given in bacterial croup.Vancomycinandcefotaximeare two most common drugs used in case of secondary bacterial infection.
