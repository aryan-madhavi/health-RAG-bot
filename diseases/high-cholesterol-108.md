HIGH CHOLESTEROL
High cholesterolAlso known as Hypercholesterolemia
OVERVIEW
Overview
Cholesterol is a fatty, wax-like substance in your blood that your body needs to build healthy cells. However, too much cholesterol can clog arteries and increase the risk of heart disease.


High cholesterol usually has no obvious symptoms, it’s often detected through a blood test. Risk factors include a diet high in saturated fats, a lack of physical activity, obesity, smoking,diabetes, and a family history of high cholesterol.


A heart-healthy lifestyle can manage and even prevent high cholesterol. It involves eating a balanced diet low in saturated and trans fats, regular exercise, and weight management. If needed, doctors may prescribe medications like statins to help lower cholesterol levels effectively.

SYMPTOMS OF HIGH CHOLESTEROL
Symptoms Of High Cholesterol

High cholesterol often doesn’t show any obvious symptoms.In rare cases where cholesterol levels are extremely high, often due to inherited conditions, it can show up in the body. Symptoms can include:
Yellowish bumps on areas like your Achilles tendon or eyelidsSwollen tendons in the handsA pale ring around the colored part of your eye.


Over time, high cholesterol can quietly raise your risk of serious heart problems like chest pain, heart attacks, or strokes. Know your numbers, get a simple blood test to check your cholesterol, and protect your heart health.

CAUSES OF HIGH CHOLESTEROL
Causes Of High Cholesterol

Before we dive into what causes high cholesterol, let’s first understand what cholesterol is. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance found in your blood. Your body needs it to build healthy cells, make hormones, and help with digestion. But having too much cholesterol can stick to your blood vessels and raise your risk of heart disease.


There are two main types of cholesterol:

LDL (Low-density lipoprotein):Also called“bad” cholesterol, because high levels can lead to buildup in your arteries, increasing the risk ofheart attackandstroke.

HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein):It is known as“good” cholesterolbecause it helps remove LDL from your bloodstream, lowering your risk of heart problems.


Note: There are also triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood. High levels of triglycerides combined with high LDL or low HDL can further increase your risk of heart disease.



WHAT HAPPENS IN THE BODY DURING HIGH CHOLESTEROL?
What happens in the body during high cholesterol?

Cholesterol travels in your blood attached to proteins called lipoproteins. When you eat foods high in saturated and trans fats, your liver makes more LDL cholesterol. If your body can’t process or remove the extra LDL efficiently, due to poor lifestyle or genetic issues, it starts to build up in the blood.


Excess LDL cholesterol gets deposited in the walls of your arteries. Over time, it combines with other substances to form plaque. This narrows and hardens the arteries (a condition called atherosclerosis), reducing blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body.


As plaque builds up, it increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, or other cardiovascular problems, especially if a piece of plaque breaks off and causes a blockage.

Did You Know?
Some people are born with high cholesterol levels. This condition, called familial hypercholesterolemia, happens when the body lacks working LDL receptors. Without them, cholesterol builds up fast, raising heart disease risk early in life.
RISK FACTORS FOR HIGH CHOLESTEROL
Risk Factors For High Cholesterol

High cholesterol is typically when LDL cholesterol levels exceed certain thresholds, depending on the presence of risk factors. These include:

MAJOR RISK FACTORS
Major risk factors
Older age (men above 45 years and women above 55 years)Sex (men have a greater risk of high total cholesterol than women)Race/ ethnicity (Non-Hispanic White, Asian (Indian, Filipino, Japanese, Vietnamese), Hispanic, African American)Family history of early heart diseaseHypertension (High blood pressure)DiabetesSmokingLow HDL levels

LIFESTYLE FACTORS
Lifestyle factors
High intake of saturated fatsLack of exerciseObesityStressOverconsumption of alcoholPoor-quality sleep

DIAGNOSIS OF HIGH CHOLESTEROL
Diagnosis Of High Cholesterol

High cholesterol is usually diagnosed with a blood test called alipid profile. This test measures the levels of different fats in your blood, like:



Total cholesterol
Desirable:< 200Borderline high:200–239High: ≥ 240

LDL (Low-density lipoprotein)
Optimal:< 100Near/above optimal:100–129Borderline high:130–159High:160–189Very high:≥ 190



HDL (High-density lipoprotein)
Normal:40–50 (men), 50–59 (women)Low:< 40 (men), < 50 (women) – linked to higher heart disease riskHigh:≥ 60 – linked to lower-than-average heart disease risk


Triglycerides
Normal:< 150Borderline high: 150–199High:200–499Very high:≥ 500



Note: Lipid testing is recommended for adults starting at age 20, while universal screening is advised for children between 9 and 11 and again at 15 to 17.

TREATMENT OF HIGH CHOLESTEROL
Treatment Of High Cholesterol


Managing high cholesterol often requires a combination of prescribed medications and healthy lifestyle changes for effective, long-term control. The lifestyle modifications are outlined in the prevention and home care section. Medication options include:



1. MEDICATIONS
1. Medications

Statins:They lower cholesterol made by the liver and help prevent heart disease. Common examples include:AtorvastatinRosuvastatinSimvastatin


Bile acid sequestrants:These block cholesterol absorption in the gut and help the liver remove more cholesterol from the blood. Commonly used drugs are:CholestyramineColesevelam


Niacin (Nicotinic acid derivatives):This class of drugs lowers bad cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing good cholesterol (HDL). For example:Vitamin B3


Fibrates:they mainly lower high triglyceride levels and slightly raise good cholesterol (HDL). Common drugs include:FenofibrateGemfibrozil


Ezetimibe: It reduces cholesterol absorption in the intestines, often used with statins.


Bempedoic acid:This is a newer drug that helps lower bad cholesterol, especially for those who can’t tolerate statins.


Omega-3 fatty acids:Can help lower triglycerides and slightly raise good cholesterol (HDL).

Here are some newer drugs that are still under research and not widely available yet:

Lomitapide:A special pill that helps people with a rare cholesterol disorder (HoFH) lower their LDL by up to 60%, but it may cause stomach issues and affect the liver.

Lerodalcibep:An experimental monthly injection that uses gene-targeting tech to sharply reduce bad cholesterol, now in advanced clinical trials.

PCSK9 vaccine:A future vaccine being studied to help the body make long-lasting antibodies that naturally lower bad cholesterol, potentially with fewer doses.

Red yeast rice:It may lower cholesterol like statins, but safety and quality vary widely.

Soy protein:Found in tofu, soy milk, etc, may slightly improve cholesterol levels.

Garlic(Lehsun):It may have a modest cholesterol-lowering effect, but there is mixed evidence.

COMPLICATIONS OF HIGH CHOLESTEROL
Complications Of High Cholesterol

High cholesterol can cause the arteries to narrow, leading to serious complications like:

Coronary heart disease:High cholesterol can clog the arteries that supply the heart, reducing blood flow and leading to heart disease.

Heart attack:If plaque fully blocks blood flow to the heart, it can cause a heart attack.

Stroke:Cholesterol buildup in brain arteries can block blood flow and trigger a stroke, either from a clot or a blocked vessel.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD):Cholesterol can clog leg arteries, causing pain when walking and, if untreated, may lead to serious complications like gangrene (when body tissue dies due to a lack of blood flow).
