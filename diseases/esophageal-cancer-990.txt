ESOPHAGEAL CANCER
Esophageal cancerAlso known as Esophageal carcinoma
OVERVIEW
Overview
Esophageal cancer develops in the esophagus, the tube connecting the throat to the stomach. Cancer occurs when the body's natural mechanism for replacing old cells with new ones breaks down.

Some of the common symptoms of esophageal cancer include difficulty in swallowing, chest pain, unintentional weight loss, and persistent heartburn.

It is frequently diagnosed in older individuals and has a higher incidence in men compared to women. Several risk factors include tobacco smoking,obesity, pre-existing esophageal conditions (such as Barrett's esophagus), excessive alcohol consumption, and a hereditary predisposition.

Treatment options for esophageal cancer are dependent on the extent and stage of the disease. Common treatment modalities include surgery to remove the cancerous tissue, chemotherapy to target and destroy cancer cells, radiation therapy to shrink tumors, or a combination of these approaches.

TYPES OF ESOPHAGEAL CANCER
Types of Esophageal Cancer

There are 2 main types of esophageal cancer, based on the type of cell involved. They include:
1. ADENOCARCINOMA
1. Adenocarcinoma
This is the most common type of esophageal cancer that starts in glandular cells (cells that form glands) near the stomach
2. SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA

2. Squamous cell carcinoma
This esophageal cancer originates from upper cells that line the inner surface of the esophagus.

There are a lot of myths surrounding cancer. Listening to our expert decodes some of the most common myths around cancer with scientific facts.

CAUSES OF ESOPHAGEAL CANCER
Causes Of Esophageal Cancer

Esophageal cancer affects the tubular passage connecting the mouth to the stomach and primarily originates in the mucosa, the moist lining of the esophagus.

Here's an overview of what happens during cancer:
DNA, the genetic material, governs cell behaviour, growth, division, and cell death.
Some genes oversee the timing of cell growth, division, and death like:
Oncogenes promote cell growth, division, and survival.
Tumor suppressor genes regulate cell division and trigger cell death when necessary.
Esophageal cancer can stem from DNA mutations that activate oncogenes or deactivate tumor suppressor genes, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and abnormal mass formation in the esophagus.Several factors can increase the likelihood of developing esophageal cancer, which is discussed in detail in the next segment.
RISK FACTORS FOR ESOPHAGEAL CANCER
Risk Factors For Esophageal Cancer

Esophageal cancer, like many other types of cancer, has several risk factors that may increase the likelihood of developing the disease. The primary risk factors for esophageal cancer include:
1. AGE
1. Age
The risk of esophageal cancer increases with age, and it is more commonly diagnosed in older adults between the ages of 45 and 70 years.

2. GENDER
2. Gender
Men are more likely to get esophageal cancer than women.

3. FAMILY OR PERSONAL HISTORY OF CANCER
3. Family or personal history of cancer
Individuals who have had head and neck cancer or esophageal cancer in the past may have a higher risk of developing esophageal cancer. Positive family history of cancer can also increase the risk.

4. MEDICAL CONDITIONS
4. Medical conditions
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
Barrett's esophagus (a condition where the normal lining of the esophagus is replaced by a tissue that is similar to the lining of the intestine)
Plummer-Vinson syndrome (characterized by a triad of symptoms: iron deficiency anemia, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), and esophageal web formation)

5. LIFESTYLE CHOICES
5. Lifestyle choices
Obesity
Physical inactivity
Tobacco smoking
Alcohol use
Diet rich in processed, packaged food, red meat and low in fruits and vegetables.
Consumption of very hot liquids

Smoking a pack or more of cigarettes daily doubles the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma compared to non-smokers. So do not let this deadly habit be the cause of your cancer.
Try Smoking Cessation Range

6. OTHER FACTORS
6. Other factors
Achalasia (a rare disorder where the muscular ring between the esophagus and stomach, fails to relax properly)
Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection
Injury to the esophagus.Did you know?
A test called geneCORE helps to assess the risk of cancer in individuals with personal or family history for one or different types of cancer.Click To Book
DIAGNOSIS OF ESOPHAGEAL CANCER
Diagnosis Of Esophageal Cancer

To arrive at the diagnosis of any kind of cancer, it is important to understand its staging. Staging is essential to determine the extent of the disease.
STAGING OF ESOPHAGEAL CANCER
Staging of esophageal cancer
The primary staging system used is the TNM system, which evaluates:
T (Tumor):This indicates how deeply the tumor has invaded the layers of the esophagus wall and the surrounding tissue.
N (Lymph Nodes):It assesses whether cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes and, if so, how close they are to the original tumor.
M (Metastasis):This assesses whether cancer has spread to other parts of the body.

Based on these criteria, esophageal cancer is categorized into the following stages:
Stage 0 ( Carcinoma in situ):Abnormal cells are present in the top layers of the esophagus, which could develop into cancer in the future.
Stage 1:At this stage, cancer is confined to the thick muscle layer of the esophageal wall and hasn't spread beyond.
Stage 2:The cancer has penetrated deeper layers of the esophagus and may have affected nearby lymph nodes.
Stage 3:Cancer cells are found in all layers of the esophagus and may have also spread to adjacent organs.
Stage 4:Cancer has spread to distant organs or lymph nodes, often the liver, and lungs, or distant lymph nodes.

The diagnostic process may include the following steps:

1. MEDICAL HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
1. Medical History and Physical Examination
The first step in diagnosing esophageal cancer is discussing your medical history and symptoms with a healthcare provider. They will perform a physical examination to check for any signs of the disease.

2. IMAGING TESTS
2. Imaging TestsCT scan:A computed tomography (CT) scan provides detailed cross-sectional images of the chest and abdomen, which can help determine the extent of the cancer and identify nearby lymph node involvement.

PET scan:A positron emission tomography (PET) scan is used to detect areas of increased metabolic activity, which can indicate the spread of cancer.

Barium swallowtest:This test helps identify any abnormalities in the esophagus, such as tumors or strictures (webs). You will be asked to drink a contrast material containing barium, which is visible on X-rays.
3. ENDOSCOPY

3. Endoscopy
It is a procedure using a flexible tube with a camera to check the body. It helps diagnose and assess esophageal cancer. It includes:Upper endoscopy:It also helps determine tumor size and spread, vital for surgery planning.

Endoscopic ultrasound:Used to measure cancer size and spread into nearby areas. It can also check lymph nodes for cancer.

Bronchoscopy:It may be performed to check if esophageal cancer has spread to the windpipe or lung tubes.

Thoracoscopy and laparoscopy:Thoracoscopy examines the chest cavity, while laparoscopy examines the abdomen.
4. CYTOLOGY

4. CytologyBrush cytology:This is a technique where cells from the esophagus lining are brushed and examined under a microscope to check for abnormalities.

Balloon cytology:In this procedure, the person swallows a deflated balloon, which is later inflated and pulled out to collect esophageal cells for analysis
A cancer diagnosis can be overwhelming, but seeking a second opinion is a key step in making informed treatment decisions. Read this article to learn six essential things you need to know.

5. BIOPSY
5. Biopsy
Tissue samples taken during the endoscopy are sent to a pathology laboratory to be analyzed by a pathologist. This is a definitive way to confirm the presence of cancer, identify its type (adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma), and assess its grade and stage.

6. BLOOD TESTS
6. Blood TestsComplete blood count (CBC):This test measures the different types of cells in your blood. It can identify signs of anemia. Esophageal cancer may induce anemia through bleeding tumors and affect liver function if it spreads.

Liver function test:A blood test to check your liver function because esophageal cancer can sometimes spread to the liver.
7. BIOMARKER TESTING OF THE TUMOR

7. Biomarker testing of the tumorHER2 testing:In advanced esophageal cancer, doctors may test biopsy samples for HER2. This protein can make cancer grow faster. This testing can be used in targeted drug therapy.

PD-L1 testing:Some esophageal cancers are assessed for the PD-L1 protein level, as tumors with more PD-L1 may respond better to immunotherapy drugs.

MMR and MSI testing:Testing is done to check for high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI) or changes in mismatch repair (MMR) genes in esophageal cancer cells. Positive results might indicate suitability for immunotherapy in cases where surgery is not an option or the cancer has recurred or spread.

TREATMENT OF ESOPHAGEAL CANCER
Treatment Of Esophageal Cancer

Here's an overview of the treatment options for esophageal cancer:
I. GENERAL TREATMENT MEASURES

I. General treatment measures1. Palliative care
It focuses on providing relief from the symptoms and side effects of cancer, improving the patient's quality of life, and managing pain.

2. Nutrition therapy
Esophageal cancer can disrupt normal nutrition intake, leading to malnutrition and dehydration. Your treatment strategy may involve a phase of body recovery and fortification before addressing the cancer itself.

Note:Dietitians can help with customized diets for swallowing issues and may recommend intravenous nutritional therapy to provide essential nutrients directly into your bloodstream.
II. LOCAL TREATMENT

II. Local Treatment1. SurgeryEsophagectomy:This is the most common surgical procedure for esophageal cancer. It involves removing part or all of the esophagus and then reconstructing it. The choice of surgery depends on the location and extent of the tumor.

Lymph node dissection:During surgery, nearby lymph nodes are often removed and examined to determine if the cancer has spread.
2. Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays or other particles to target and destroy cancer cells. It is of two types:
External-beam radiation therapy:The most popular kind of radiation therapy, in which radiation is administered externally to the body via a machine.

Internal-beam radiation therapy (brachytherapy):When radiation treatment is given using implants, it is called internal radiation therapy or brachytherapy. Brachytherapy involves the application of a radioactive source near the tumor.
3. Endoscopic treatmentEndoscopic mucosal resection:Used for dysplasia (pre-cancer) and early-stage esophageal cancers. Involves removing abnormal tissue with instruments passed through the endoscope.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT):Used for Barrett's esophagus, dysplasia, early-stage esophageal cancers, and to relieve obstruction in advanced cancers. Involves injecting a light-activated drug that accumulates in cancer cells. Laser light activates the drug to kill cancer cells, which are removed during endoscopy.

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA):A balloon with electrodes is inserted via endoscopy and delivers an electrical current to kill abnormal cells. Normal cells replace the treated area over time.

4. Treatments to keep the esophagus openLaser ablation:Uses a laser beam through an endoscope to open a blocked esophagus due to advanced cancer. Often requires repeated procedures.

Argon plasma coagulation:Similar to laser ablation but uses high-temperature argon gas and a spark. Used for esophageal blockage relief.

Electrocoagulation (electrofulguration):Burns tumors off with electric current, helpful for relieving esophageal blockage.

Esophageal stent:A mesh device placed into the esophagus to keep it open. Typically made of metal or plastic and used after other endoscopic treatments.

III. SYSTEMIC TREATMENT
III. Systemic treatment1. Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy (chemo) is treatment with anti-cancer drugs that are injected into a vein or taken by mouth, which allows them to enter the blood and reach most parts of the body. Drugs used for chemotherapy include:CarboplatinPaclitaxelOxaliplatinCapecitabineCisplatin5-fluorouracil (5-FU)

Types of chemotherapy include:Adjuvant chemotherapy:It is given after surgery and is sometimes coupled with radiation therapy. In addition to preventing recurrence, the objective is to eradicate any cancer cells that may have been left behind after surgery due to their smaller size.

Neoadjuvant or induction chemotherapy:This is used prior to surgery, either with or without radiation, this helps reduce the size of some bigger malignancies so that less tissue is removed during surgery. This may result in less severe surgical side effects and issues.

Chemo for advanced cancers:Chemotherapy can also be used to reduce tumor size and alleviate symptoms in cancers that have progressed to other organs, like the liver. Therapy frequently prolongs people's lives, even if therapy is unlikely to cure the cancer.

Chemoradiation:By itself, chemo rarely cures esophageal cancer so it is often given with radiation therapy.
2. Targeted therapy
It is the use of medicines that are designed to target specific molecules or proteins involved in cancer cell growth. These therapies may be used in cases of advanced or metastatic esophageal cancer. Some targeted drugs include:TrastuzumabRamucirumabEntrectinibLarotrectinib

3. Immunotherapy
This therapy uses medicines to help boost a person’s own immune system to find and destroy cancer cells more effectively. It typically works on specific proteins involved in the immune system to enhance the immune response. Drugs used are:PembrolizumabNivolumab

COMPLICATIONS OF ESOPHAGEAL CANCER
Complications Of Esophageal Cancer

Esophageal cancer can lead to various complications, including:

1. Functional gastric emptying disorder:Following surgery or treatment, individuals may experience difficulties with the normal emptying of the stomach.

2. Severe diarrhea and reflux esophagitis:Treatment and surgery for esophageal cancer can cause digestive issues, including severe diarrhea and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), resulting in acid reflux and inflammation of the esophagus.

3. Pulmonary infection:As food or liquids are aspirated into the lungs due to swallowing difficulties, it can result in pulmonary infections, potentially leading to pneumonia and other respiratory issues.

4. Chylothorax:It is the accumulation of lymphatic fluid (chyle) in the chest cavity that can occur in some cases, leading to breathing difficulties.

5. Anastomotic fistula:This is a condition where a surgical connection (anastomosis) between two parts of the digestive tract, typically the esophagus and stomach, may develop a leak or fistula, leading to infection and further surgical interventions.

6. Complications from treatment:Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery can have their own set of complications, including infection, scarring, and long-term side effects.

Note:Advanced stages may result in cancer spreading to vital organs such as the liver, lungs, bones, adrenal glands, kidneys, and brain via the bloodstream.
ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR ESOPHAGEAL CANCER
Alternative Therapies For Esophageal Cancer

Complementary and alternative therapies can be considered alongside conventional medical treatments for esophageal cancer after consultation with your medical team. Some complementary therapies may include:
1. ACUPUNCTURE
