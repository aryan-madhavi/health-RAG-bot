MEASLES
MeaslesAlso known as Rubeola
OVERVIEW
Overview
Measles is a highly contagious viral disease caused by the measles virus. It spreads through respiratory droplets from coughs or sneezes.

Symptoms typically appear 10–14 days after exposure and include high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a distinctive red rash that usually starts on the face and spreads downward. Koplik spots—tiny white spots inside the mouth—are also a classic sign.

Measles can lead to serious complications, such aspneumoniaandencephalitis,especially in young children and immunocompromised individuals.

Vaccination with the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine is the most effective prevention method.

There is no specific treatment for measles. However, symptomatic care, including good nutrition, adequate fluid intake, rest, along with vitamin A supplements, can help in alleviating symptoms.

SYMPTOMS OF MEASLES
Symptoms Of Measles

Measles symptoms usually begin 7 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. The illness starts with:Highfever(can reach up to 104°F / 40°C)CoughRunny noseRed, watery eyes (often sensitive to light)Swollen eyelidsTirednessand weaknessLoss of appetite


Koplik spots

Appears 1–2 days before the skin rash
Look like small grayish-white spots inside the cheeks or on the roof of the mouth
May be present for a few days
Not seen in all patients


Measles rash

Typically develops 3–5 days after initial symptoms, around 2 weeks post-infection
Begins as red spots, progressing to small red-brown patches that may join together
Usually starts on the face and neck, then spreads to the rest of the body
Rash fades in the same order it appeared
In malnourished children, skin peeling (desquamation) may follow rash resolution
Immunocompromised individuals may not develop a rash due to a weak immune response


Other symptoms

Some patients may also experience:
HeadacheStomach painVomitingDiarrheaMuscle pain (myalgia)When is Measles Contagious?
A person with measles is contagious from 4 days before the appearance of the rash to about 4 days after the rash develops.


During this time, the infected person can easily transmit the virus to others, even before they realize they are sick.

CAUSES OF MEASLES
Causes Of Measles

Measles is caused by the morbillivirus, a highly contagious virus that belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family. The virus spreads easily from person to person through:

Airborne droplets are released when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks
Direct contact with the nasal or throat secretions of an infected person
Touching contaminated surfaces and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth, the virus can remain infectious in the air or on surfaces for up to two hours
Sharing food, drinks, or utensils with an infected person
Close physical contact, such as kissing, hugging, or handshakes
Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding.

RISK FACTORS OF MEASLES
Risk Factors Of Measles

While measles can affect anyone, certain risk factors increase the likelihood of contracting the disease. Some of these risk factors include:

1. LACK OF VACCINATION
1. Lack of vaccination

Not receiving the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine is the most significant risk factor.Unvaccinated children and adults are highly susceptible during outbreaks.


2. TRAVEL TO AREAS WITH LOW VACCINATION COVERAGE
2. Travel to areas with low vaccination coverage

Visiting or living in regions with frequent measles outbreaks increases risk, especially where immunization rates are low.


3. WEAKENED IMMUNE SYSTEM
3. Weakened immune system

People with HIV/AIDS, cancer, or those on immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, organ transplant recipients) are at higher risk of infection and complications.


4. VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY
4. Vitamin A deficiency

Increases the severity of measles, especially in children. It is also linked to a higher risk of complications like blindness and pneumonia.


5. AGE
5. Age

Infants and young children are at the highest risk of severe disease.Older adults may also have complications if they were never immunized.



6. CLOSE CONTACT WITH AN INFECTED PERSON
6. Close contact with an infected person

Measles is extremely contagious. The majority of non-immune people in close contact with an infected person will contract the virus.

DIAGNOSIS OF MEASLES
Diagnosis Of Measles

Measles is diagnosed based on clinical symptoms, history of exposure, and laboratory tests. Here’s a breakdown of how the diagnosis is made:

1. CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS
1. Clinical diagnosis

The doctor will evaluate the symptoms, vaccination status, recent travel, exposure to infected individuals, immune status, and nutritional deficiencies like vitamin A, especially in children.
A rash, high fever, and Koplik spots are key clinical signs that suggest measles, especially if the patient has been exposed to someone with the disease or is in an area with active measles transmission.

2. LABORATORY TESTS
2. Laboratory tests

While a clinical diagnosis may be sufficient in many cases, laboratory tests are often used for confirmation, especially in areas where measles is not common.

Serology:Blood tests to detect measles-specific IgM antibodies or a fourfold rise in IgG antibodies are commonly used.

IgM antibodies appear shortly after the onset of the rash and are usually detectable within 3 days of the rash onset.IgG antibodies indicate past infection or immunity.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR): A PCR test can detect the measles virus's genetic material (RNA) in samples, typically from the throat, urine, or blood. This is especially helpful during outbreaks.

There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, so management mainly focuses on supportive care to relieve symptoms and prevent complications. Here's an overview of the treatment approach:

1. SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT
1. Symptom Management

FeverOver-the-counter medications such asparacetamoloribuprofencan help reduce fever and discomfort.

Cough and congestionUse of a humidifier or saline nasal spray can relieve nasal congestion.Cough suppressants may be considered, but it’s important to consult a doctor before using them, especially for children.

Eye careLubricating eye drops can help ease discomfort from conjunctivitis (red eyes).Avoiding bright lights can reduce sensitivity.

2. VITAMIN A SUPPLEMENTATION
2. Vitamin A supplementation
Supplementation is recommended, especially for young children and undernourished individuals, as it has been shown to reduce the severity of the illness and prevent complications like pneumonia and blindness.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends two doses of vitamin A for children diagnosed with measles.


3. ANTIBIOTICS (FOR SECONDARY INFECTIONS)
3. Antibiotics (for secondary infections)
Measles weakens the immune system, which can lead to secondary bacterial infections like pneumonia, otitis media (ear infection), or sinus infections.

Antibiotics may be prescribed if a bacterial infection develops as a complication.



5. HOSPITALIZATION (IN SEVERE CASES)
5. Hospitalization (in severe cases)
Hospitalization may be required for individuals with severe complications, such as measles pneumonia, encephalitis, or severe dehydration.

In the hospital, patients may receive intravenous fluids, oxygen therapy, or other supportive treatments as needed.


6. POST-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS
6. Post-exposure prophylaxis

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with immune globulin (IG) can be administered within 6 days of exposure for those at high risk (e.g., infants, pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals) to prevent or lessen the severity of the disease.

While there’s no specific treatment for measles, proper home care can help manage symptoms, prevent complications, and speed up recovery. Here’s how you can care for someone with measles at home:

1. REST AND COMFORT
1. Rest and comfort

Encourage the patient to get plenty of rest to support the immune system.
Keep the patient in a calm, quiet, well-ventilated room to avoid overstimulation.



2. HYDRATION
2. Hydration

Measles can lead to dehydration due to fever and potential diarrhea. Encourage frequent fluid intake, such as water, clear soups, and oral rehydration solutions.
Offer small, frequent sips of fluids to make drinking easier for the patient.



3. ISOLATION
3. Isolation

To prevent the spread of measles, keep the patient in isolation at home, especially during the contagious period (from 4 days before to 4 days after the rash appears).
Limit contact with other family members and avoid public spaces.

4. RASH CARE
4. Rash care
Apply cool, damp cloths to the affected areas to help soothe the skin and reduce itching.

Applying a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer to the rash after a bath can help lock in moisture and prevent the skin from becoming too dry, which can worsen itching.

Aloe veragel may also help soothe irritated skin. Ensure it is pure aloe vera without added fragrances or alcohol.

Colloidal oatmeal baths are often recommended for soothing itching caused by rashes.

Avoid tight clothing or fabrics that can irritate the rash, such as wool. Opt for loose, soft cotton clothing to help reduce friction and irritation.

Avoid scratching. Encourage the patient (especially children) not to scratch the rash, as this can lead to infection and scarring.

Hot water can irritate the skin and worsen itching. Opt for cool or lukewarm showers instead.

5. NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
5. Nutritional support

Vitamin A:Vitamin A supplementation is crucial for measles, especially for children. It has been shown to reduce the risk of complications like pneumonia.
If a doctor recommends it, ensure that you are following the correct dosage as per their guidelines.


Vitamin C:Known for its immune-supporting properties, vitamin C may help reduce the duration and severity of cold-like symptoms that can accompany measles.
Consume foods rich in vitamin C, such as citrus fruits, bell peppers, and leafy greens, or take a supplement under the guidance of a healthcare provider.

COMPLICATIONS OF MEASLES
Complications Of Measles

Measles is a highly contagious viral infection that can lead to serious complications, especially in young children, adults with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women. While many people recover from measles without lasting effects, the following complications can arise and may lead to severe health issues or even death:
Pneumonia:Pneumonia is the most common cause of death from measles. The virus can infect the lungs, leading to inflammation, fluid buildup, and difficulty breathing.

Encephalitis(Brain inflammation):Encephalitis is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication where the brain becomes inflamed, leading to neurological issues.

Ear infections (Otitis media):Measles can lead to bacterial infections in the middle ear, causing pain and discomfort.
Blindness:Measles can cause damage to the eyes and, in severe cases, lead to blindness. This is more common in developing countries where vitamin A deficiency is prevalent.
Pregnancy-related complications:Pregnant women who contract measles are at risk for complications like premature labor, miscarriage, and low birth weight.
Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE):SSPE is a rare but fatal complication that occurs many years after a measles infection (usually 7-10 years later). It results in progressive brain degeneration.
