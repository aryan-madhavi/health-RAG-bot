FATTY LIVER DISEASE
Fatty liver diseaseAlso known as NAFLD, Steatosis, Hepatic steatosis, and Fatty Liver Hepatitis
OVERVIEW
Overview

The liver is a critical organ in the human body that helps support metabolism, immunity, digestion, detoxification, and vitamin storage, among other functions. Fatty liver disease is the accumulation of abnormal amounts of fat within the liver cells that compromise the liver's ability to perform.

Fatty liver disease can be caused by excess alcohol consumption or other causes, which is known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease(NAFLD). Most people do not know that they have NAFLD during the initial stages. It only presents symptoms or signs in case of a progression to liver failure.

NAFLD has become increasingly common with the increasing prevalence of its risk factors like obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol.

The treatment of NAFLD is based on the cause and how far the disease has progressed. Lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, managing weight, and keeping blood sugar and cholesterol under control are the cornerstone of managing this condition. A liver transplant may be required in severe cases.

TYPES OF FATTY LIVER DISEASE
Types Of Fatty Liver Disease

Fatty liver disease is broadly categorized into 2 types. These are:


1. ALCOHOL-RELATED FATTY LIVER DISEASE (AFLD)
1. Alcohol-related fatty liver disease (AFLD)
Alcoholic fatty liver disease occurs due to the consumption of alcohol in excessive amounts.
2. NONALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE (NAFLD)

2. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is not related to alcohol consumption. We will be focusing on this type in detail.
NAFLD is further classified as:
Fatty liver (isolated fatty liver or IFL)
Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)

In both isolated fatty liver and NASH there is a high amount of fat in the liver cells, but, in addition, in NASH there is inflammation within the liver, and, as a result, the liver cells are damaged and are replaced by scar tissue.
SYMPTOMS OF FATTY LIVER DISEASE
Symptoms Of Fatty Liver Disease

Fatty liver disease can progress through four stages, which include:
Simple fatty liver: It refers to the deposition and buildup of excess fat in the liver. It is usually harmless if it doesn’t progress.
Steatohepatitis: This refers to when there is inflammation in the liver along with fat deposition.
Fibrosis: This stage occurs when constant inflammation in the liver begins causing scarring. However, the liver can still function normally.
Cirrhosis:In this stage, scarring of the liver has become widespread, weakening the liver’s ability to function. This is a serious stage and is irreversible.

With NAFLD there are usually no symptoms in the early stages. However, in a few cases, the patient may feel tired and have discomfort in the upper right side of the abdomen. Incirrhosis(latter stages of NAFLD), the following symptoms can be observed:
Weakness or fatigue
Swollen belly
Abdominal pain
Loss of appetite
Weight loss
Confusion
Enlarged blood vessels underneath your skin
Larger than normal breasts in men
Edema (swelling), especially in the legs
Fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites)
Skin and eyes appear yellow due tojaundice
Dark-colored urine
Pale stools

Did you know?The liver excretes bilirubin, a substance that helps the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. It also helps to remove wastes and toxic matter from the blood. A malfunctioning liver cannot excrete adequate amounts of bilirubin, and is one of the primary causes of jaundice.Learn more about jaundice
CAUSES OF FATTY LIVER DISEASE
Causes Of Fatty Liver Disease

In fatty liver disease, excess fat gets stored in liver cells.

Insulin resistance is the primary reason leading to NAFLD. Insulin resistance is when cells in your muscles, fat, and liver don't respond to insulin, leading to excessive glucose (sugar) in your blood. Also, elevated insulin levels and insulin resistance promote the continuous synthesis of fat in the liver.

Numerous risk factors for the development of NAFLD have been espoused, with most having some form of metabolic defect or insulin resistance at the core.

Don’t toy with your liver. Read about 6 habits that could be damaging it.

RISK FACTORS FOR FATTY LIVER DISEASE
Risk Factors For Fatty Liver Disease

NAFLD is primarily caused by the deposition of fats in the liver and the various risk factors include:
1. DIET AND DIETARY HABITS
1. Diet and dietary habits
High frequency of eating fast foods, and larger food portions that contain high saturated fats and refined carbohydrates can increase the risk of NAFLD.
Dietary habits like inappropriate mealtimes, including the habit of eating too much at evening and night, missing breakfast, and eating too rapidly also predispose to insulin resistance and thereby NAFLD.
2. OVERWEIGHT OR OBESITY

2. Overweight or obesity
Obesity is a strong risk factor for NAFLD. According toa study, up to 75% of people who are overweight and 90% of people who are obese are suffering from NAFLD.
3. HIGH BMI

3. High BMI
Anotherstudysuggests that adults with a high BMI (Body mass index is a measure of body fat based on the height and weight of an adult) rate may have a risk of NAFLD.
4. AGE

4. Age
The risk of developing NAFLD increases with age because older people begin experiencing organ dysfunction. A relatively high proportion of individuals with progressive forms of NAFLD develop cirrhosis by the time they are in their70s or beyond.
5. FAMILY HISTORY

5. Family history
Researchshows that liver fat fraction and fatty liver condition are inherited traits and tend to run in families.

6.TYPE 2 DIABETES
6.Type 2 diabetes
Diabetes significantly raises the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In most cases, Type 2 diabetes mellitus and NAFLD exist together.

7. HIGH CHOLESTEROL
7. High cholesterol
Dyslipidemia, i.e. high levels of triglycerides and LDL (bad cholesterol) or low levels of HDL (good cholesterol) in the blood can predispose to NAFLD.
8. METABOLIC SYNDROME

8. Metabolic syndrome
Metabolic syndrome is a combination of risk factors which predispose a person to developing type Ⅱ diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

The current diagnostic criteria require having 3 of 5 of the following factors:
Triglycerides (150 mg/dL or greater)
HDL cholesterol (less than 40 mg/dL in men and less than 50 mg/dL in women)
High fasting glucose (100 g/dL or greater)
Increased waist circumference (defined by population specific data)
High blood pressure (greater than 130/85 mmHg)

It is observed that the incidence of NAFLD has been increasing in concert with the rising rates of metabolic syndrome.

9. POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME (PCOS)
9. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
Theprevalenceof NAFLD is higher in women suffering from PCOS. PCOS puts women at increased risk of insulin resistance, a critical factor in liver damage.
10. OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA

10. Obstructive sleep apnea
Evidenceshows that obstructive sleep apnea can induce non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by increasing insulin resistance, inflammation, and dyslipidemia.

11. HEPATITIS INFECTIONS
11. Hepatitis infections
HBV and HCV (hepatitis B and C viruses respectively) affect millions of people globally and are a major cause of chronic liver disease, including NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease).
12. GENETIC CONDITIONS

12. Genetic conditions
Defective LIPA gene which is clinically known as Wolman’s disease and cholesterol ester storage disease (CESD) can lead to chronic liver diseases. Fibrosis leading to cirrhosis is seen intwo-thirdsof patients with LIPA deficiency.

13. CERTAIN MEDICATIONS
13. Certain medications
Side effects of certain medicines, such as corticosteroids, antidepressants, and antipsychotics can induce fatty liver disease.
14. SMOKING

14. Smoking
Smoking predisposes to the development of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, which are significant risk factors for fatty liver disease.

DIAGNOSIS OF FATTY LIVER DISEASE
Diagnosis Of Fatty Liver Disease

NAFLD can be hard to diagnose because many people do not have any signs and symptoms initially. A combination of laboratory and imaging tests is required to confirm a diagnosis. The diagnostic procedure include:

1. MEDICAL HISTORY
1. Medical history
Your doctor will evaluate the presence of risk factors and also the absence of excessive alcohol intake.
2. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

2. Physical examination
During a physical examination, your doctor will look for any physical signs of impaired liver function like pale yellow skin, jaundice, red palms, enlarged breasts tissue in men (gynecomastia), small or enlarged testicles, and swelling of the upper stomach.
To check for liver inflammation, they may press on your abdomen as an enlarged liver can be felt along the lower edge of the right rib cage.
3. BLOOD TESTS

3. Blood tests
Liver function test (LFT):This test helps show the abnormal levels of enzymes and proteins produced by the liver, including bilirubin, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, etc.

Complete blood count (CBC):This test may help detect any infection or anemia that may be caused due to internal bleeding.

Fasting serum glucose:Increased levels of fasting serum glucose correlate with the degree of steatosis in NAFLD patients and may be used as a marker of severe hepatic steatosis.

Hepatitis antibody test:This test may help to rule out hepatitis BandC (mainly)virus infections that may cause serious liver inflammation and damage.

Other blood tests:Antibodies are screened for autoimmune liver conditions, which includeantinuclear antibody (ANA),anti-smooth muscle antibody (SMA), andanti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA) tests.

4. IMAGING TESTS
4. Imaging tests
The doctor may advise imaging tests to get a better understanding of the patient’s condition. The following imaging tests can show the size, shape, texture, and inflammation of the liver:


Abdominalultrasound:It is a non-invasive, widely available, and accurate procedure for the detection of fatty liver disease. On ultrasound images, fatty liver looks brighter than normal liver, and cirrhotic livers (advanced stage) look lumpy and shrunken.
Abdominal computed tomography (CT):This procedure uses x-ray equipment with computers to produce multiple and detailed digital images of the liver. It can help detect mild to advanced steatosis as well as other liver diseases.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):This technique requires a magnetic field, radio frequency pulses, and a computer to produce detailed pictures of the liver. A dye that is injected into the veins of the patient, helps the liver to be seen more clearly on the scan. It allows accuracy for the detection of damage caused by various liver diseases.
Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP): MRCP is a special type of MRI that is used to evaluate a part of the liver and gallbladder.
Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE):This test assesses the stiffness, inflammation, and severity of scarring in the liver.
Transient elastography (fibroScan):This test helps quantify liver fibrosis (scarring).


5. LIVER BIOPSY
5. Liver biopsy
In this procedure, fine tissue samples are collected from the liver with a needle or during surgery. The liver biopsy should be considered in all patients with unexplained elevations in serum aminotransferases (e.g., with findings negative for viral markers or with no history of alcohol use). It offers high accuracy in the detection of fatty liver disease.

TREATMENT OF FATTY LIVER DISEASE
Treatment Of Fatty Liver Disease

The first-line treatment for fatty liver disease is lifestyle intervention with diet modifications and exercise regime.
1. DIETARY MODIFICATIONS

1. Dietary Modifications
Healthy, mindful eating is key to induce weight loss without malnutrition. The following tips can be of great help. However, it is always advisable to work in conjunction with regular interactions with a dietician.
Avoid fast food, canned and packaged food items
Limit sugar intake
Count your calories. It is advisable to consume 1000‐1200 calories per day for women and 1200‐1600 calories per day for men.
Goal is to achieve a weight loss of 0.5 to 1.0 kg per week.
Aim for gradual but consistent weight loss over 6 to 12 months.

At the same time, macronutrients including carbohydrate, protein, fat and micronutrients including vitamins, minerals, and supplements must be well balanced.

Here is your guide to eating habits that lead to a healthy weight without compromising on all-round nutrition.Watch This Vedio




2. EXERCISE REGIME
2. Exercise Regime
120 minutes of aerobic exercise, such as running and swimming every week, increases glucose uptake by improving insulin sensitivity and reducing hepatic fat content.

NAFLD is also improved with resistance exercises, which may be more tolerable for patients who suffer from poor cardiorespiratory fitness and cannot tolerate intense aerobic workouts.

Astudyhas also shown that modified high-intensity interval training (HIIT) of five cycles of high-intensity cycling followed by 3-min recovery periods, three times/week for 12 weeks, leads to a reduction in liver fat.

However it is important that an individualized exercise be developed based on
The severity of underlying liver dysfunction from NAFLD
Class of obesity
Exercise tolerance status
Presence of individual components of metabolic syndrome and other comorbid medical problems

3. WEIGHT LOSS USING MEDICATIONS
3. Weight loss using medications
While weight can be mostly managed by caloric restriction from dietary modifications and physical exercise, medications likeOrlistatcan aid in moderate weight loss by reducing the absorption of fat.


4. BARIATRIC SURGERY
4. Bariatric surgery
Sometimes, exercise and diet modifications fail to lose weight in excessively obese people. It increases insulin sensitivity in the liver, muscles, and fat along with improving overall metabolic health.

5. DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS
5. Dietary supplements
Certain vitamin supplements can give a helping hand in managing fatty liver disease. These include:
Vitamin E: It reduces triglycerides as well as oxidative stress, which contributes to decreasing the progression of fatty liver in patients. Natural sources include wheat germ oil, sunflower seeds, almonds, peanuts, spinach, pumpkin, and red bell pepper. Supplements can also be considered if your diet is not able to meet the demands.

Check out our extensive range of vitamin E supplements.Fill Your Cart NowVitamin C:Vitamin C gives protective effects against liver oxidative damage. It also prevents fatty accumulation in the liver.

Include vitamin C-rich items like lemons, oranges, strawberries, blackcurrants, broccoli etc. in your diet.
You can also take vitamin C supplements to cover any gaps in your diet.Shop Now
Vitamin D:Deficiency of Vitamin D can result in insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and NAFLD. Astudyfound that 70% of patients with NAFLD have vitamin D deficiency. Therefore, appropriate levels of vitamin D can help in management of fatty liver disease.

Bask in the morning sunshine to boost your Vitamin D levels. You can also augment it by taking Vitamin D supplements.

6. MEDICATIONS
6. Medications
There are no specific medicines for fatty liver disease. However, the doctor may prescribe medicines for the management of underlying conditions like:

High Triglycerides and cholesterol:Medications include:
Atorvastatin
Lovastatin

Viral hepatitis:If fatty liver disease is long-term, the doctor may prescribe antiviral medicines like
Lamivudine
Entecavir
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate

Diabetes or insulin resistance:Antidiabetic medicines include:
Metformin
Rosiglitazone
Pioglitazone

7. LIVER TRANSPLANTATION
7. Liver transplantation
In advanced cases of fatty liver disease, when the liver completely loses its ability to function, a liver transplant is the last treatment option.

It is a procedure to replace a patient’s liver with a healthy liver from a deceased donor or with part of a liver from a living donor. Candidates for liver transplants undergo extensive testing to find whether they are healthy enough to have a good outcome following surgery.
COMPLICATIONS OF FATTY LIVER DISEASE
Complications Of Fatty Liver Disease

Fatty liver disease can turn into a life-threatening condition if it progresses into inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis of the liver. And, if left untreated, it can eventually lead to the following:
1. BLEEDING
1. Bleeding
Inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis can affect the liver's ability to make enough clotting factors. Hence, the chance of severe bleeding increases.


2.JAUNDICE
2.Jaundice
Fatty liver diseases may affect the liver’s ability to eliminate high levels of bilirubin, a waste product, from the blood leading to jaundice.


3. INFECTIONS
3. Infections
Fatty liver disease also reduces the body’s immunity to fight infections. Fatty liver is associated with recurrent bacterial infections.


4. CHRONIC VIRAL HEPATITIS
4. Chronic viral hepatitis
Progression to fibrosis and cirrhosis is more rapid when there is any form of concomitant liver infection with fatty liver disease.
5.OSTEOPOROSIS

5.Osteoporosis
Some patients tend to lose their bone strength and are at a higher risk of bone fractures.Researchshows that patients with NAFLD were 1.35 times more likely to develop osteoporosis when compared to individuals without NAFLD.
6.DIABETES

6.Diabetes
Diabetes may worsen if someone already has it and develops cirrhosis and complete liver damage.

7. LIVER FAILURE
7. Liver failure
Patients who are suffering from long-term fatty liver disease have the highest risk of liver failure.
8. LIVER CANCER

8. Liver cancer
Scarring and cirrhosis increase the chances of liver cancer, most commonly a type called hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

9. ACUTE FATTY LIVER OF PREGNANCY (AFLP)
9. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP)
It is a rare but serious complication that occurs during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Proper delivery and supportive care can help the patient with better recovery.

Note:Liver health will likely return to normal within a few weeks of giving birth.
ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR FATTY LIVER DISEASE
Alternative Therapies For Fatty Liver Disease

Complementary therapies that can help on managing the symptoms of NAFLD include:

1. TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE (TCM)
1. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
TCM has been widely used to treat NAFLD for centuries in Asia, and its holistic concept shows advantages in the treatment of this condition. This treatment is mainly focused on preventing damage to the liver, increasing insulin sensitivity, and improving the immune system.

2. ACUPUNCTURE THERAPY
2. Acupuncture therapy
This is another traditional Chinese medicine-based approach, in which thin needles are inserted into the body that helps in healing. Astudyhas demonstrated that acupuncture can effectively treat NAFLD by inhibiting inflammation and promoting fat metabolism in liver cells.
