ENDOMETRIAL CANCER
Endometrial cancerAlso known as Uterine cancer or Cancer of the endometrium
OVERVIEW
Overview
Endometrial cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the lining of the uterus (womb), called the endometrium. It happens when cells in this lining begin to grow abnormally and form a tumor. The exact cause isn’t always clear, but it often develops when there is an imbalance between estrogen and progesterone hormones, leading to excessive growth of the uterine lining.


Abnormal vaginal bleeding (especially after menopause), spotting, pelvic pain, or unusual discharge are some of the common symptoms. Factors likeobesity,diabetes, never having been pregnant, starting periods early, late menopause,polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and family history of certain cancers can increase the risk of endometrial cancer.


Most cases are detected early because abnormal bleeding is noticed quickly. The prognosis is generally good if the condition is diagnosed early. Treatment may include surgery (removal of the uterus), radiation, hormone therapy, or chemotherapy, depending on the stage.

CAUSES OF ENDOMETRIAL CANCER
Causes Of Endometrial Cancer

Endometrial cancer develops when cells in the lining of the uterus (endometrium) start to grow uncontrollably due to genetic and hormonal changes. If not detected early, it can grow deeper into the muscle wall of the uterus (myometrium) and spread further.

How does endometrial cancer spread in the body?

Local spread:It may extend into nearby areas, such as the cervix or pelvic tissues.

Lymphatic spread:Cancer cells can travel through lymph vessels to nearby lymph nodes.

Ovaries and fallopian tubes:The cancer can also spread upward through lymphatic channels.

Abdomen and pelvis:In advanced stages, it may reach the peritoneum and other pelvic organs.

If you notice persistent abnormal symptoms, don’t ignore them. Getting a transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) early can help detect problems at the right time.

RISK FACTORS FOR ENDOMETRIAL CANCER
Risk Factors For Endometrial Cancer

Endometrial cancer risk is shaped by a mix of hormonal, genetic, lifestyle, and metabolic factors, like:

1. HORMONE-RELATED
1. Hormone-relatedEstrogen-only replacement therapy (HRT)Estrogen-secreting tumors (rare)Chronic anovulation (not releasing eggs regularly)Tamoxifen therapy (breast cancer drug with estrogen-like effect on the uterus)Early menarche (periods starting young)Latemenopause(menopause happening later)Infertility / menstrual disruption/amenorrhea (skipped periods).

2. METABOLIC AND HEALTH CONDITIONS
2. Metabolic and health conditionsObesityType 2 diabetesType 1 diabetesPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)Hyperinsulinemia and metabolic syndrome

3. GENETIC AND HEREDITARY FACTORS
3. Genetic and hereditary factorsLynch syndromeCowden syndromeFamily history of endometrial,ovarian cancer, or colorectal cancerHistory ofbreast cancer

4. LIFESTYLE FACTORS
4. Lifestyle factorsIncreased body mass index (BMI)Poor dietSedentary lifestyleAlcohol consumption

5. DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS
5. Demographic factorsWomen after menopause (55+)People of African descent.


DIAGNOSIS OF ENDOMETRIAL CANCER
Diagnosis Of Endometrial Cancer

Detecting endometrial cancer early might impact the prognosis. Diagnosis consists of:

HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAM
History and physical exam
Doctors ask about symptoms (like abnormal bleeding), lifestyle, and family cancer history.
Genetic counseling may be advised if there’s a strong family link like Lynch syndrome.



ENDOMETRIAL BIOPSY
Endometrial biopsy
This is the gold standard test.
A small tissue sample is taken from the uterus lining for lab analysis

When is it recommended?

Any vaginal bleeding after menopause
Women ≥35 with persistent irregular bleeding
Women with risk factors (obesity, PCOS, family history, tamoxifen use, Lynch syndrome)
Abnormal ultrasound findings (like thickened lining ≥4 mm after menopause)

IMAGING TESTS
Imaging tests
Ultrasound transvaginal:It checks the thickness and appearance of the uterine lining.

MRI pelvis:Gives a clear picture of the uterus and nearby tissues to check if the cancer has spread locally.

CT scan:Shows whether the cancer has spread to lymph nodes, abdomen, chest, or other distant areas.

PET CT scan:Detects cancer activity in the body by highlighting areas where cancer cells are more active.

BLOOD TESTS
Blood tests
Complete blood count (CBC):This is a simple blood test that checks for anemia or other effects of prolonged bleeding.

Genetic or molecular tests:This test helps classify the cancer more precisely and guide treatment planning.

STAGING OF ENDOMETRIAL CANCER
Staging of endometrial cancer

Staging describes how far the cancer has spread:
Stage I:Cancer is only in the uterus
Stage II:Cancer has spread to the cervix
Stage III:Cancer has reached nearby tissues, ovaries, fallopian tubes, vagina, or lymph nodesStage IV:Cancer has spread to the bladder, bowel, or distant organs like the lungs, liver, etc.
SPECIALIST TO VISIT
Specialist To Visit

A gynecologist is usually the first doctor to evaluate symptoms like abnormal bleeding. They may refer you to the following specialists:
Gynecologic oncologistMedical oncologistRadiation oncologistPathologistsGenetic counselor


Agynecologic oncologistis a specialist in cancers of the female reproductive system, best for diagnosis confirmation and treatment planning.


Amedical oncologistprovides chemotherapy or targeted therapy if needed.


Aradiation oncologistmanages cases that require radiation therapy.

Apathologistexamines tissue samples under a microscope to confirm diagnosis, determine cancer type, and guide the treatment plan for endometrial cancer.


Agenetic counselormay be recomended if you have a family history of cancers like Lynch syndrome.

When to see a doctor?

See a doctor if you notice:
Unusual vaginal bleedingHeavy or prolonged periodsAbnormal vaginal dischargePelvic pain or pressure that doesn’t go awayDifficulty urinating, constipation, or bloating with no clear reason.

If these symptoms persist, consult a gynecologist promptly for evaluation.

PREVENTION OF ENDOMETRIAL CANCER
Prevention Of Endometrial Cancer

You may not be able to completely avoid endometrial cancer, but small lifestyle and health choices can go a long way in protecting you. Tips that can help:

STAY ACTIVE
Stay Active
Extra body fat increases estrogen levels, which fuels cancer growth in the uterus.
Regular exercise and keeping your weight in check greatly reduce this risk.

Not a fan of the gym? Stay active at home with our easy-to-use exercise equipment and get your daily workout without stepping out.

USE HORMONES FOR PROTECTION
Use hormones for protection

Birth control pills (with both estrogen and progesterone) can lower the risk.
Hormonal IUDs (like the levonorgestrel IUD) protect the uterus by balancing hormone levels.

BREASTFEED YOUR BABIES
Breastfeed your babies

Having children and breastfeeding reduces lifetime risk by naturally balancing hormone exposure.

ADOPT A PLANT-FOCUSED DIET
Adopt a plant-focused diet

Eating plenty of vegetables and following a Mediterranean-style dietary pattern have been linked with a lower risk of endometrial cancer.

PRIORITIZE VITAMIN C
Prioritize Vitamin C

A genetic study found that higher levels of circulating vitamin C are associated with reduced endometrial cancer risk.

Whether black or with milk, a daily cup of coffee may slightly lower your risk of endometrial cancer. Research shows that regular coffee drinkers enjoy a modest protective benefit.
TREATMENT OF ENDOMETRIAL CANCER
Treatment Of Endometrial Cancer

Endometrial cancer treatments are tailored to each individual based on how advanced the cancer is. Early-stage disease is often curable with surgery, while more advanced cases may benefit from additional therapies. These include:

1. SURGERY
1. Surgery

Hysterectomy:This is the surgical removal of the uterus, which is where endometrial cancer begins.

Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO):This procedure removes both ovaries and fallopian tubes. With this, the main source of estrogen is cut off, which can fuel cancer growth.

Lymph node sampling/dissection:The surgeon removes a few lymph nodes near the uterus to check if cancer has spread beyond the womb.

2. RADIATION THERAPY
2. Radiation therapy

External beam radiation:It uses high-energy X-rays from outside the body to target and kill cancer cells in the pelvis.

Vaginal brachytherapy:In this therapy, a small radiation source is placed inside the vagina to directly treat the area where cancer is most likely to return.

3. CHEMOTHERAPY
3. Chemotherapy

Often used along with surgery for high-risk or advanced tumors, and may be administered before surgery to shrink the tumor or afterward to lower recurrence risk. Common drugs include:CarboplatinPaclitaxelCisplatinIfosfamide



4. HORMONE THERAPY
4. Hormone therapy

Suitable for select cases where cancer cells are hormone-sensitive
This treatment lowers estrogen activity to slow tumor growth, especially valuable in advanced or recurrent settings.

5. NEWER ADVANCEMENTS
5. Newer advancements

Targeted therapy: this therapy works by blocking the pathways; targeted drugs can slow down or even stop the cancer while usually causing fewer side effects. Examples include:LenvatinibEverolimus

Immunotherapy:It is especially used in tumors with mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR), reducing disease progression significantly. Drugs used are:PembrolizumabDostarlimab
