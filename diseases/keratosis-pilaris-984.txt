SYMPTOMS OF KERATOSIS PILARIS
Symptoms Of Keratosis pilaris

Keratosis pilaris (KP) is a common skin condition that is characterized by the appearance of tiny bumps on the skin. These bumps look similar to that of a plucked chicken or goosebumps, giving it the name “plucked chicken skin” and “goosebump skin”.

CAUSES OF KERATOSIS PILARIS
Causes Of Keratosis pilaris

The term keratosis means ‘scaly skin’, and pilaris means ‘hair’.
Keratosis pilaris occurs due to the buildup of “keratin” in hair follicles. Keratin is a protein that protects the skin from environmental damage. It is present in skin, hairs, and nails.
The exact cause of this formation is not known. Mutations (genetic changes) in a protein called filaggrin which plays a role in skin barrier function is mostly thought to cause this.
