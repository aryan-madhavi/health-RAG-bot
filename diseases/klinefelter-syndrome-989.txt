KLINEFELTER SYNDROME
Klinefelter syndromeAlso known as XXY male, XX male, XXYY male, XXXY male, and XXXXY male
OVERVIEW
Overview
Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic disorder in which males are born with an extra X chromosome.
The key features of KS include small testis, low sperm count or no sperms, low sex drive, learning disabilities and differences in appearance, weak bones, and enlarged breasts.
Testosterone replacement therapy is the gold standard of treatment. Speech therapy, behavioral therapy, physical therapy, and occupational therapy help manage other associated symptoms.
Early diagnosis helps in the successful preservation of fertility as the sperm count starts declining rapidly after puberty.

CAUSES OF KLINEFELTER SYNDROME
Causes Of Klinefelter syndrome

Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic disorder which occurs due to an abnormal number of chromosomes.
Chromosomes are thread-like structures that consist of protein and DNA. It carries the genetic information from cell to cell. Each cell normally contains 46 (23 pairs) of chromosomes.
The males have one X and one Y chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes.
In 80-90% of the cases, KS men have 47 chromosomes with an extra X chromosome denoted as 47,XXY. However, some individuals with KS can have two extra chromosomes also denoted as (48, XXXY or 48XXYY). In rare cases, a structurally abnormal X chromosome can also be the reason for KS.
The extra X chromosome originates from non-separation of sex chromosomes during multiplication of cells. This could happen either during multiplication of eggs or sperms. It can also happen very less frequently (<3%) during early division of the fertilized egg.
Did you know?
The effects on physical and mental development increase with the number of extra X chromosomes. Each extra X is associated with a decrease in IQ by about  approximately 15–16 points. It mostly affects language processing in children, particularly expressive skills.
RISK FACTORS FOR KLINEFELTER SYNDROME
Risk Factors For Klinefelter syndrome

Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic disorder. There are no known factors that increase the risk of KS. The error that produces the extra X chromosome occurs randomly and can affect anyone.
However, studies have shown that the risk of delivering the son with KS increases with the age of the mother.
It is also seen that babies born with artificial reproductive techniques such as ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) and IVF (in vitro fertilization) also have an increased chances of chromosomal anomalies.


Did you know?
KS is also seen in domestic and wild animals.
DIAGNOSIS OF KLINEFELTER SYNDROME
Diagnosis Of Klinefelter syndrome

Most of the men with KS remain undiagnosed or diagnosed very late. Poor awareness and absence of any specific sign in all patients leads to delay in diagnosis.
The diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities in newborns with altered testicles is the best way to increase the diagnostic rate. The various diagnostic approaches used to predict KS are:
HORMONAL ASSAYS
Hormonal assays
Individuals with KS have fluctuations in the concentration of several hormones. The hormonal assays do not confirm the disease. However, these tests help in guiding the treatment plan. The hormonal assays that are recommended in KS includefollicle stimulating hormone (FSH),luteinizing hormone (LH),testosterone, and gonadotropins.
KARYOTYPING (CHROMOSOME ANALYSIS)
Karyotyping (chromosome analysis)
It is the gold standard and the only way to confirm KS. In this, the chromosomes are examined under a microscope using a blood sample. A karyotype test shows the same results at any time in a person's life.
TESTICULAR BIOPSY (TESE)
Testicular biopsy (TESE)
It includes removing a piece of tissue from testicles for examination. KS individuals have altered structure and function of testis.
The procedure is expensive and invasive. It is only recommended in patients with negative chromosomal karyotyping having relatable symptoms.
PRENATAL TESTING
Prenatal testing
Klinefelter syndrome can be diagnosed before the birth of the baby. These tests are usually performed between the 11th and 14th weeks of pregnancy. It includes:
Amniocentesis:This involves examination of amniotic fluid – fluid that surrounds the baby during pregnancy.
Chorionic villus sampling:It involves removing and testing a small sample of cells from the placenta. Placenta is the organ that connects the mother's blood supply with the growing baby.
Cell-free DNA testing:During pregnancy, some DNA of the unborn baby circulates in the mother’s bloodstream. This testing involves the examination of chromosomal abnormalities through mother’s blood.
These prenatal testing possess a small risk of miscarriages. Due to this they are not recommended to perform routinely. Prenatal testing for chromosomal abnormalities are performed in the following cases:
If the women is 35 years of age or older than that
If the woman had another baby with a chromosomal abnormality
If the fetal ultrasound look abnormal
If other prenatal tests does not look normal

To experience a hearty and healthful pregnancy it is imperative to have regular health check ups. Book pregnancy tests to detect health problems in the growing fetus.

TESTING OF ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS
Testing of associated symptoms
ROUTINE BONE DENSITY SCREENING
Routine bone density screening
It is recommended in all confirmed KS individuals because androgen deficiency increases the risk ofosteoporosis.
HYPERCOAGULABILITY SCREENING
Hypercoagulability screening
Hypercoagulability refers to the increased tendency of the blood to form clots. It is seen in conditions such as deep vein thrombosis andpulmonary embolism.

The screening for hypercoagulability is recommended in KS individuals since they are prone to these disorders.
SPECIALIST TO VISIT
Specialist To Visit

KS often remains undiagnosed till adulthood. Most of the diagnoses are made during fertility treatment.

PREVENTION OF KLINEFELTER SYNDROME
Prevention Of Klinefelter syndrome

Klinefelter syndrome cannot be prevented as it is a genetic condition. The changes in the chromosomes happen before birth.
However, the risk can be reduced by conceiving early. It is because the chances of delivering a KS baby increases if the mother is above 35 years of age.
TREATMENT OF KLINEFELTER SYNDROME
Treatment Of Klinefelter syndrome

The early identification plays a very important role in the management of Klinefelter syndrome. Various treatment modalities for management of symptoms include:
TESTOSTERONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY
Testosterone replacement therapy
This therapy improves the hormonal status of the KS patients through the administration of testosterone.
The two forms that are widely used include testosterone enanthate and testosterone cypionate which are injected intramuscularly. The dose of testosterone depends upon the age of the patient. Once initiated, the therapy should continue throughout the life of the patients.
SPEECH THERAPY
Speech therapy
This is used in children to develop skills that aid in comprehension and learning. It involves several treatment sessions either one on one or in a group. The treatment approach include:
Exercises to differentiate and produce  sounds
Exercises to improve fluency of speech
Exercises to improve breathing and swallowing
Sessions to improve communication using sign language, communication boards and computer assisted speeches
PHYSICAL THERAPY (PHYSIOTHERAPY)
Physical therapy (physiotherapy)
It is recommended in boys who have reduced muscle mass and delayed motor skills. This therapy helps in improving muscle tone, balance and coordination. It includes guided movements and massages by the therapist on the patient’s body. The treatment also involves stimuli such as heat, cold, and electrical currents.
OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY
Occupational therapy
This therapy is recommended in boys that have trouble coordinating normal physical movements such as walking up or down stairs, kicking balls, or jumping. It also helps infants who have difficulty in feeding from a bottle or latching.
TREATMENT FOR INFERTILITY
Treatment for infertility
KS is the most common cause of infertility in males. But, assisted reproductive technologies (ART) have enabled over 50% of men with Klinefelter syndrome to have their own children.
Testicular sperm extraction- intracytoplasmic sperm injection (TESE-ICSI):It involves extracting the few viable sperms from a small portion of testicular tissue. The sperm is then injected into the egg through a technique called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).

Here are some common fertility myths and their facts.

SURGERY
Surgery
The enlarged breast puts a psychological strain on the patient. It also increases the chances of breast cancer. The surgical removal of breasts (mastectomy) is indicated in such patients.
COMPLICATIONS OF KLINEFELTER SYNDROME
Complications Of Klinefelter syndrome

Klinefelter syndrome increases the risk of several health conditions:
AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS
Autoimmune disorders
These are the disorders in which the immune system attacks the healthy cells of one’s own organs and tissues. The decreased testosterone in KS individuals increases the chances of autoimmune disorders such as:

Systemic lupus erythematosus
Rheumatoid arthritis
Sjogren syndrome

OSTEOPOROSIS
Osteoporosis
Testosterone prevents bone breakdown. A marked reduction in testosterone increases the risk of bone-related disorders such as osteoporosis in KS.
ENDOCRINE DISORDERS
Endocrine disorders
KS individuals have an increased risk of developingdiabetesover a period of time. The risk ofhypothyroidismand hypoparathyroidism also increases in KS.
VENOUS DISEASES
Venous diseases
KS predisposes the patients to several venous diseases such asvaricose veins, venous ulcers, and pulmonary embolism.
TAURODONTISM
Taurodontism
It refers to the changes in the tooth shape characterized by  in which the roots are reduced in size and the body of the tooth is enlarged. KS individuals have a high chance of developing this disorder.
INTELLECTUAL AND PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS
Intellectual and psychiatric disorders
Children with Klinefelter syndrome possess neurocognitive abnormalities such as low IQ, difficulty in speech and learning, and language issues.
Such children are at increased risk of developing dyslexia (a learning disorder that involves difficulty in reading) and attention-deficit disorder.
The symptoms such as feminine physical features, poor motor coordination, and difficulties in speech and memory impact the self-esteem of the individual.
The disfigurement and infertility can also lead to several psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression.
BREAST CANCER
Breast cancer
It is seen that KS individuals have 20 times more chances of developing breast cancer than normal men. Studies suggest that this risk is higher in men having gynecomastia.
EXTRAGONADAL GERM CELL TUMORS
Extragonadal germ cell tumors
Extragonadal germ cell tumors form in parts of the body other than the gonads (testicles or ovaries). KS increases the risk of developing these tumors, especially in the mediastinum (space in your chest that holds your heart).
LIVING WITH KLINEFELTER SYNDROME
Living With Klinefelter syndrome

KS impacts the males psychologically due to the difference in physical features. They are also seen to be concerned about sexuality, masculinity and fertility after a diagnosis. Here are a few steps that can help living with this condition:
BE INFORMED
Be informed
Most of the individuals have a lack of knowledge regarding KS. Parents of KS individuals should take professional support to care for their children.
ENSURE PERIODIC SCREENING
Ensure periodic screening
Individuals with KS should regularly go for associated complications such as osteoporosis, diabetes, breast cancer, anxiety or depression.
GO FOR FERTILITY PRESERVATION
Go for fertility preservation
Sperm retrieval at prepubertal and adolescent age proves to be more successful. The preservation of sperm at a younger age also avoids more invasive surgical procedures in the future.
