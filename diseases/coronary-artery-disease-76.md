CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
Coronary artery diseaseAlso known as Ischemic heart disease, Coronary heart disease, and Arteriosclerotic heart disease
OVERVIEW
Overview

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a condition where the arteries that supply blood to the heart become narrowed or blocked due to the buildup of plaque (atherosclerosis). Symptoms include chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, fatigue, and in severe cases,heart attack. However, some people may have no symptoms until the disease significantly worsens.

Men are generally at a higher risk of developing coronary artery disease (CAD) at a younger age. However, women's risk increases after menopause due to the decline in protective estrogen levels. Family history, advancing age,high blood pressure, an abnormal cholesterol profile,diabetes,obesity, and smoking are the major risk factors for CAD.

Management of CAD includes lifestyle changes like consuming a heart-healthy diet, an exercise regime, and cessation of smoking and alcohol. Medications can help to manage risk factors along with treating the symptoms. Surgery might be advised in severe cases.

SYMPTOMS OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
Symptoms Of Coronary Artery Disease


Angina or chest pain is the most common symptom of CAD. Angina develops when too much plaque deposits inside the arteries and narrows them.Â Angina may cause symptoms like-Heaviness or tightness in the chestTirednessIndigestionHeartburnSweating

For many people, aheart attackis the first clue that they have CAD. A few symptoms of a heart attack include-Chest pain or anginaWeaknessNauseaCold sweatDiscomfort in the arms or shoulderShortness of breath or trouble breathingHeart palpitations


Over time, CAD can weaken the heart muscle. This may lead toheart failure, a life-threatening condition where the heart cannot pump blood the way it should.

Are you confused between angina, heartburn, and heart attack?

TYPES OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
Types Of Coronary Artery Disease


The different forms of coronary artery disease include:
1. OBSTRUCTIVE CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
1. Obstructive coronary artery disease
This is the most common type of coronary artery disease. It develops when coronary arteries gradually narrow due to plaque buildup. As the narrowing progresses, it can eventually block blood flow to the heart.


2. NONOBSTRUCTIVE CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
2. Nonobstructive coronary artery disease
This form of CAD is more common in females than males. It is not the result of plaque buildup but occurs due to other coronary artery problems, such as:
Constriction at inappropriate times
Malfunctioning in smaller artery branches
Damage to the artery lining


3. SPONTANEOUS CORONARY ARTERY DISSECTION (SCAD)
3. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD)
SCAD occurs when a tear in the wall of the coronary artery partially or completely blocks the blood flow. This form can unexpectedly present as a heart attack.

CAUSES OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
Causes Of Coronary Artery Disease


Atherosclerosis or the gradual buildup of plaque in coronary arteries (the major blood vessels in the body that supply blood to the heart) causes coronary artery disease.

Over time, this plaque which is made up of cholesterol, waste products, calcium, and fibrin (which helps in blood clotting) narrows or blocks the coronary arteries. This affects their function to supply enough blood, oxygen, and nutrients to the heart. It leads to chest pain and puts you at risk of a heart attack.

Various factors can elevate the risk of coronary artery disease, which are explored in detail in the next section.
RISK FACTORS FOR CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
Risk Factors For Coronary Artery Disease


Multiple risk factors can lead to coronary artery disease. They are broadly divided into non-modifiable and modifiable factors:


I. NON-MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS
I. Non-modifiable risk factors

Hereditary:Genetic factors are a significant risk factor of CAD. People with a family history of CAD are more prone to develop this condition.

Age:The risk of CAD significantly increases after 35 years of age in both men and women.

Gender:Men are more likely to have CAD as compared to women. Evidence has shown thatlipoprotein (a)which is a cardiovascular risk factor seems to be elevated in men more than in women.

Note:Women are more prone to cardiovascular diseases including CAD after menopause as protective estrogen levels decline.


II. MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS
II. Modifiable risk factors

Hypertension (High blood pressure):High blood pressure is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease. It is characterized by blood pressure in the arteries and other blood vessels greater than 185/115 mm Hg.

Abnormal cholesterol profile:Dyslipidemia, i.e. high LDL (bad cholesterol) and triglycerides with low HDL (good cholesterol) raises CAD risk by promoting plaque buildup that blocks arteries and reduces oxygen-rich blood flow to the heart.

Monitor your cholesterol levels regularly for early detection and proactive heart disease prevention.
Book Lipid Profile Test

Diabetes:The risk of heart disease is higher in men than women with diabetes.

Note:India is the Diabetes capital of the world. Diabetes not only predisposes to heart disease but a plethora of other long-term complications.

Listen to our expert talk about Diabetes, its various complications, and their prevention.
Watch Now


Obesity:The majority of individuals with CHD are overweight or obese.


Lack of physical activity:A sedentary lifestyle predisposes to obesity, high blood pressure, high bad cholesterol, and diabetes, which are all major risk factors for CAD.


A diet rich in unhealthy fats:A diet loaded with saturated fats, trans fat, and packaged food increases the risk of obesity and high bad cholesterol by many folds. This results in excessive plaque formation in coronary arteries, leading to CAD.


Vitamin D deficiency:Moderate to severe vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases including high blood pressure, CAD, and heart failure.

Read about various causes of Vitamin D and when to get tested for its optimum levels.
Have A Glance

Excessive alcohol intake:Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure levels and the risk of heart disease.

Tobacco:Smoking increases plaque deposition in arteries and reduces the capacity of blood to carry oxygen, predisposing to CAD.

Periodontitis:It is a severe gum infection that can lead to tooth loss. Research has suggested that periodontitis can expose the body to oral bacteria which can lead to the development of plaque buildup in blood vessels and coronary heart disease.


Chronic kidney disease (CKD):Individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) exhibit an elevated risk of coronary artery disease due to accelerated ageing of the cardiovascular system.


Air pollution:Breathing polluted air increases heart disease risk by accelerating blood vessel aging and promoting plaque buildup in the arteries.Did you know?
Exposure to road traffic noise, particularly above 60 dB, is linked to coronary artery disease in adults. Nighttime traffic noise disrupts sleep, raising stress hormones, which can increase blood pressure and elevate cardiovascular risk.
DIAGNOSIS OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
Diagnosis Of Coronary Artery Disease

CAD is usually diagnosed through the following:

1. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND MEDICAL HISTORY
1. Physical examination and medical history
The doctor will check parameters like blood pressure and ask about medical history, lifestyle, and family history.
The symptoms of chest pain and pain in the jaw, neck, left arm, or back are assessed. Shortness of breath is evaluated during rest and in case of activity.


2. IMAGING TESTS
2. Imaging tests
Chest X-ray:This test can reveal heart enlargement or signs of fluid buildup, indicating possible heart failure related to the condition.


Electrocardiogram (ECG):This test helps detect electrical abnormalities in the heart that may indicate coronary artery disease (CAD).


Echocardiography:It provides real-time images of the heart's structure and function to assess damage or reduced blood flow to the heart due to CAD.


Treadmill test(Stress test):This test evaluates how the heart responds to physical activity, revealing potential issues related to CAD or heart function.


Computed tomography (CT) scan: It identifies plaque buildup in the coronary arteries, a key indicator of coronary artery disease.


MRI (Cardiac):This test detects tissue damage or blood flow issues in the heart and coronary arteries, pointing to CAD.


Cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) scan:This test is used to see areas of the heart muscle with insufficient blood supply, a sign of CAD.


Coronary calcium scoring:Measures calcium buildup in the coronary arteries, helping to assess CAD risk.


Nuclear ventriculography:This is a non-invasive test that uses radioactive material to assess heart function and detect abnormalities in the heart chamber, linked to CAD.


Coronary angiography:The gold standard for CAD diagnosis, it visualizes blockages and severity in coronary arteries using contrast dye.


Electrophysiology study:It assesses the electrical system of the heart to detect arrhythmias or electrical abnormalities caused by CAD.

3. BLOOD TESTS
3. Blood tests
Cholesterol total:It measures overall cholesterol levels to assess the risk of CAD; high levels of cholesterol (>240 mg/dL) increase the risk.


Triglycerides (Tg):High triglyceride levels (>150 mg/dL) can contribute to CAD risk by promoting plaque buildup in arteries.


Cholesterol LDL:Elevated LDL(low-density lipoprotein) (>190 mg/dL) leads to plaque formation in arteries, increasing the risk of CAD.


Cholesterol HDL:Higher HDL (High-density lipoprotein) (>60 mg/dL) reduces the risk of CAD by removing LDL (bad cholesterol) from the bloodstream and promoting better blood flow.


CRP (C-reactive protein):Elevated CRP levels generally indicate inflammation and an increased risk of heart disease, even before symptoms appear.


Lipoprotein (a):It is used to assess genetic predisposition. High levels of lipoprotein (a) suggest an increased risk of heart disease, blood clots, and stroke, elevating CAD risk.


Troponin:Elevated troponin levels indicate damage to the heart muscle, which signals an increased risk of heart disease or a heart attack.


Homocysteine:High levels of homocysteine are linked to the severity of CAD and increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.


NT-pro (BNP):Increased BNP levels reflect heart strain and damage, often correlating with worsening coronary artery disease.

TREATMENT OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
Treatment Of Coronary Artery Disease


Treatment for coronary artery disease (CAD) involves managing the symptoms and reducing the risk of further problems. CAD can be managed effectively with a combination of lifestyle changes, medications, and, in a few cases, surgery.

A. MEDICATIONS
A. Medications
1. Blood thinners:Blood thinners are a class of medicine that helps reduce the risk of a heart attack by thinning the blood and preventing it from clotting. Common blood thinners are:ClopidogrelRivaroxabanTicagrelorAspirin

2. Beta-blockers:These medicines are used to treat angina and high blood pressure.Â Â Common beta blockers are:AtenololBisoprololMetoprolol

3. Statins:This class of drugs works by blocking the formation of bad cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein, LDL). Common statins are:RosuvastatinPravastatinAtorvastatin


4. Calcium channel blockers
This class of drug works by decreasing blood pressure by relaxing the muscles, which causes the arteries to become wider and reduces blood pressure. Common calcium blockers are:AmlodipineVerapamilDiltiazem


Note:Popping calcium supplements without consulting your doctor could increase the risk of plaque buildup in arteries. Learn more about this.

5. Nitrates:Nitrates are referred to as vasodilators that are used to widen your blood vessels. Common Nitrates are:Glyceryl trinitrateIsosorbide mononitrate


6. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors:These medicines block the activity of a hormone called angiotensin-2, which causes the blood vessels to narrow. Common ACE inhibitors are:RamiprilLisinopril


Note:Heart medications should never be stopped suddenly without consulting your doctor as there is a risk of making symptoms worse.
B. SURGERY

B. Surgery
Coronary angioplasty:Also called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or balloon angioplasty, this procedure uses a small balloon to widen narrowed arteries, improving blood flow.


Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG):CABG is also known as bypass surgery or a heart bypass. It is a procedure to restore blood flow to areas of your heart that are blocked, causing heart attacks and CAD.


Heart transplant:When the heart is severely damaged and is unable to adequately pump blood around the body, a heart transplant may be needed.
COMPLICATIONS OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
Complications Of Coronary Artery Disease


Chest pain (angina):In the case of narrowed coronary arteries, the blood supply to the heart is not enough. This can lead to chest pain (angina) or shortness of breath.

Irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias):When the heart does not receive sufficient blood and oxygen due to CAD, the normal heart signaling can get altered leading to irregular heartbeats.

Heart failure:The narrowed arteries due to CAD makes the heart weak and difficult for the heart to perform its functions eventually leading to heart failure.

Heart attack:The rupture of plaque in one of the coronary arteries can result in the formation of blood clots. This blood clot can stop the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart leading to a heart attack.
