EXCESSIVE BURPING
Excessive burpingAlso known as Belching, Eructation, Rucking, and Rifting
OVERVIEW
Overview
Burping is a normal bodily function; however, when excessive burping becomes repetitive and affects a person's daily activities, it can be bothersome and embarrassing.

Excessive burping, or belching, occurs when gas is released from the digestive system through the mouth too frequently or in excessive amounts. Other symptoms may include bloating, abdominal discomfort, acidity, regurgitation, and feeling full.


It can be caused by factors like swallowing air, consuming carbonated drinks, overeating, or underlying conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).


Rest assured, treatment for excessive burping is available and effective. It depends on the underlying cause and may involve lifestyle modifications, medication, or further interventions, all of which can provide significant relief.

CAUSES OF EXCESSIVE BURPING
Causes Of Excessive Burping

When there's too much air in your stomach, it triggers a process where your body naturally gets rid of it.
This process includes relaxing the lower esophageal sphincter (that lets food go into your stomach), moving the air up through the esophagus (food pipe), and eventually out through the upper esophageal sphincter, sometimes making a burping sound.
So, burping is just your body releasing extra stomach air.
Many factors can induce excessive burping, which will be discussed in the next section.

Clarithromycin
Amoxicillinormetronidazole
Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) such as omeprazole or lansoprazole
5. Muscle relaxants:Muscle relaxants likeBaclofenmay be used for sensitive reflux or unexplained heartburn.

Strictures (narrowing of the esophagus)
Barrett's esophagus (precancerous changes in the lining of the esophagus)
An increased risk of esophageal cancer.

2. Irritation of the throat and vocal cords:Frequent and forceful burping can irritate the throat and vocal cords, leading to a hoarse voice, chronic cough, or throat discomfort.


3. Digestive disorders:Excessive burping may be associated with digestive disorders such as
Peptic ulcers
Gastroparesis (delayed stomach emptying)
Inflammatory bowel disease

4. Social and emotional impact:Excessive burping can be embarrassing, and it may cause discomfort in social situations or lead to self-consciousness and anxiety.

5. Nutritional deficiencies:Conditions like malabsorption disorders or certain GI diseases can hinder nutrient absorption, potentially leading to nutritional deficiencies when not addressed.
