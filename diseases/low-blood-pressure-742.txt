LOW BLOOD PRESSURE
Low blood pressureAlso known as Hypotension and Low BP.
OVERVIEW
Overview

Hypotension, or low blood pressure, is a condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Unlike hypertension (high blood pressure), hypotension receives less attention but is equally important for overall health. Various factors can lead to hypotension, including dehydration, certain medications, and underlying medical conditions such as heart problems or neurological disorders. Age can also play a role, with older adults being more susceptible to sudden drops in blood pressure, especially when standing up (orthostatic hypotension).

Hypotension is a blood pressure reading consistently below 90/60mmHg (millimetres of mercury). While many people with low blood pressure experience no symptoms, others may suffer from dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, or blurred vision. These symptoms can significantly impact daily life and overall well-being.

To manage hypotension, it's essential to identify the underlying cause. Treatment options may include lifestyle changes such as increasing fluid and salt intake, adjusting medications, and addressing specific health issues. In some cases, compression stockings or medications might be recommended to help maintain blood pressure levels.

Ignoring hypotension can lead to complications, particularly if it results in frequent falls or injuries from fainting. Therefore, recognizing the symptoms and seeking appropriate treatment is crucial for maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle.

SYMPTOMS OF LOW BLOOD PRESSURE
Symptoms Of Low Blood Pressure

Here are some signs of low blood pressure to watch for:
Blurred vision or impaired sightCold, clammy, or pale skinEmotional changes such as depression, cognitive difficulties like confusion, or trouble concentratingPhysical symptoms like fatigue, dizziness, orfainting spellsIncreased thirst indicating dehydrationUnexpected episodes of sweating despite ambient temperatureSensation of chillsNauseaor the urge to vomitNeck orback painRapid and shallow breathing
Did you know?
Many who believe they have low blood pressure may be in the normal range. There's a condition called isolated diastolic hypotension, where only the diastolic pressure is low (below 60 mm Hg), despite normal systolic readings. This is more common in older adults and deserves attention for overall cardiovascular health.

TYPES OF LOW BLOOD PRESSURE
Types of Low Blood Pressure

When it comes to your health, knowing the ins and outs of blood pressure is key. Before discussing types of blood pressure, let's delve into the fundamentals: blood pressure and low blood pressure.Understand Blood Pressure and Low Blood Pressure
Blood pressurerefers to the force exerted by your blood against the walls of your arteries as it circulates through your body, which is essential for blood flow and delivering oxygen and nutrients.


Low blood pressure (hypotension):When your blood pressure falls below normal levels and may be accompanied by various symptoms.

A standard blood pressure reading comprises two numbers:

1. Systolic pressure (top number): Pressure when the heart pumps.
2. Diastolic pressure (bottom number): Pressure when the heart rests.

Normal blood pressure reading: 120/80 mmHg.
Low blood pressure: below 90/60 mmHg.

Here are several types of low blood pressure

1. Orthostatic hypotension (or postural hypotension)
It occurs when blood pressure drops suddenly upon standing up. It's commonly observed in older adults and pregnant women. It can be triggered by factors such as dehydration, prolonged bed rest, or certain medications.

2. Postprandial hypotension
It refers to a drop in blood pressure occurring 1-2 hours after eating, particularly in older adults with conditions such as high blood pressure orParkinson's disease.

3. Neurally mediated hypotension
It involves a drop in blood pressure after prolonged standing, primarily affecting young adults and children. It results from a communication breakdown between the heart and brain.Did you know?

Combatting orthostatic symptoms is possible with simple techniques. Gradually change positions, avoid prolonged standing, and engage in activities like leg crossing, squatting, and muscle tensing for immediate relief.
CAUSES OF LOW BLOOD PRESSURE
Causes Of Low Blood Pressure

Hypotension, or low blood pressure, occurs when blood pressure drops below the normal range, leading to decreased blood flow and oxygen delivery to vital organs. Typically, the body regulates blood pressure through mechanisms like adjusting heart rate and constricting blood vessels. However, when it fails to compensate for the drop, symptoms arise.

Low blood pressure can stem from various underlying factors, including:

1. Dilation of small arteries (arterioles)
The widening of small arteries reduces resistance to blood flow, lowering blood pressure. Causes include severe infections, certain medications, spinal cord injuries, allergic reactions, and adrenal insufficiency.

2. Certain heart disorders
Conditions like heart attacks, valve disorders, irregular heartbeats, and abnormal rhythms can reduce the heart's pumping efficiency, leading to hypotension.

3. Low blood volume
Dehydration, bleeding, or kidney disorders can reduce the amount of circulating blood, lowering blood pressure.

4. Medical conditions
Hormonal disorders, severe infections, thyroid issues, low blood sugar, diabetes, and neurological problems can disrupt blood pressure regulation.

5. Medications
Certain medicines like diuretics, antihypertensives, Parkinson's disease medications, antidepressants, and erectile dysfunction drugs can cause hypotension as a side effect, especially those for high blood pressure.Did you know?

COMPLICATIONS OF LOW BLOOD PRESSURE
Complications Of Low Blood Pressure

While some people experience no symptoms with low blood pressure, for others, it can lead to various complications that can significantly impact their health and well-being. Here are some potential consequences:


1. Falls and injuries
Symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting spells often accompany low blood pressure. These symptoms substantially elevate the risk of falls, thereby increasing the likelihood of sustaining fractures, head injuries, and other severe complications, particularly among older adults.

2. Reduced blood flow to vital organs
When your blood pressure drops, your heart has to work harder to pump blood throughout your body. This can lead to insufficient blood flow to vital organs like your brain, heart, and kidneys.

3. Brain damage
Insufficient oxygen-rich blood reaching the brain due to low blood pressure can result in temporary or permanent brain impairment. Symptoms may manifest as confusion, memory issues, and difficulty concentrating..

4. Heart problems
Prolonged low blood pressure can strain the heart, potentially leading to heart-related issues such as heart attacks or strokes over time.

5. Multi-organ failure
Untreated hypotension, especially in impending or fulminant shock, can result in multi-organ failure due to inadequate blood flow to vital organs.

6. Increased mortality risk
Unaddressed severe hypotension may eventually lead to death due to compromised cardiac output and organ dysfunction.

7. Shock
Untreated hypotension may progress to shock, a life-threatening condition where the body's organs do not receive enough oxygen and nutrients, potentially leading to systemic failure.
