MENINGITIS
MeningitisAlso known as Inflammation of meninges, Meningoencephalitis, Brain fever, Cerebrospinal fever, Cerebromeningitis, Epidemic meningitis, and Leptomeningitis
OVERVIEW
Overview
Meningitis is the inflammation of the meninges, the protective layers covering the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include decreased consciousness, seizures, lethargy, confusion, high fever, rashes, rapid breathing, and neck stiffness.

It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, or non-infectious factors like cancers, lupus, certain medications, head injuries, and brain surgery. Major risk factors include poor vaccination, advanced age, chronic health conditions, and living in high-endemic areas.

Meningitis is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention. Bacterial meningitis is treated with antibiotics and steroids, while viral meningitis is managed with supportive care. Prompt treatment is essential to prevent complications such as hearing loss, memory problems, speech issues, and sepsis. Timely intervention can significantly reduce the risk of long-term effects.

CAUSES OF MENINGITIS
Causes of Meningitis

Meningitis is inflammation of the meninges, the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It can be caused by various infectious agents, as well as non-infectious conditions. The causes are typically classified into the following categories:

1. INFECTIOUS CAUSES OF MENINGITIS
1. Infectious causes of meningitis

A. BACTERIAL MENINGITIS
A. Bacterial meningitis

It is the most severe and potentially life-threatening form.
Common causative organisms include:
Neisseria meningitidis (Meningococcal meningitis)Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumococcal meningitis)Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)Listeria monocytogenes (Affects newborns, the elderly, and immunocompromised)Group B Streptococcus (Major cause in neonates)Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Causes tuberculous meningitis)

Routes of entry:
Via bloodstreamLocal infections (e.g., otitis media,sinusitis, pharyngitis)Structural defects in the dura mater (e.g., trauma, surgery)Skull fracturesNeurosurgical procedures

Transmission:
Person-to-person via respiratory droplets (e.g., N. meningitidis)Contaminated food (e.g., unpasteurized dairy, deli meats for Listeria)Asymptomatic carriers may transmit certain bacteria (e.g., N. meningitidis) without becoming ill themselves


B. VIRAL MENINGITIS
B. Viral meningitis

This form is usually milder and more common than bacterial forms. It is typically self-limiting, however, severe illness is more likely in infants, the elderly, or immunocompromised patients.

Common viral agents include:
Enteroviruses (e.g., Coxsackievirus, Echovirus)Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV)Mumps,Measles, Influenza virusesArboviruses (e.g., West Nile virus, Zika virus)Cytomegalovirus (CMV)Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)


C. FUNGAL MENINGITIS
C. Fungal meningitis

It is a rare type that mostly affects immunocompromised individuals.
Common fungal pathogens include:Cryptococcus neoformansHistoplasma capsulatumCoccidioides immitisBlastomyces dermatitidisCandida speciesMucormycosis


D. PARASITIC MENINGITIS
D. Parasitic meningitis

This is an extremely rare but potentially fatal form of meningitis.
Causative parasites:Naegleria fowleri (Causes Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis)Angiostrongylus cantonensisToxoplasma gondii


2. NON-INFECTIOUS CAUSES
2. Non-Infectious causes
A. Autoimmune or inflammatory diseasesSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)Sarcoidosis

B. CancersLeukemia, lymphoma, or metastatic cancers can spread to the meninges.

C. Medications
Certain drugs (e.g., NSAIDs, intravenous immunoglobulin) can rarely trigger drug-induced aseptic meningitis.


D. Head injury or brain surgery
Can introduce pathogens or lead to chemical inflammation of the meninges.

SYMPTOMS OF MENINGITIS

Did You Know?
Fungal, parasitic, and non-infectious meningitis are not contagious, while viral and bacterial meningitis are highly contagious. These infections can be spread through sneezing, coughing, kissing, or sharing personal items like utensils and toothbrushes. The infection is often transmitted by individuals who carry the viruses or bacteria in their nose or throat but do not show any symptoms themselves.
DIAGNOSIS OF MENINGITIS
Diagnosis Of Meningitis

The diagnosis of meningitis typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation, medical history, and several diagnostic tests to determine the cause of the infection. Here’s a general overview of how meningitis is diagnosed:

1. MEDICAL HISTORY AND SYMPTOMS REVIEW
1. Medical history and symptoms review

The doctor will begin by asking about symptoms such as fever, headache, stiff neck, sensitivity to light, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and skin rashes.


A detailed medical history, including recent infections, travel history, or exposure to someone with meningitis, will be gathered.



2. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
2. Physical examination

The healthcare provider will perform a physical exam, checking for signs like a stiff neck, rash, or sensitivity to light, which are common in meningitis cases.


Specific signs like Brudzinski's sign (involuntary flexion of the knees when the neck is flexed) or Kernig's sign (pain when extending the leg at the knee) may be checked.



3. BLOOD TESTS
3. Blood tests

Initial blood tests in the case of meningitis suspicion may include:Complete blood count (CBC)C-reactive protein (CRP)Coagulation studiesElectrolytesBlood culturesmay be performed to detect bacterial infections that could be causing meningitis.


4. LUMBAR PUNCTURE (SPINAL TAP)
4. Lumbar puncture (spinal tap)

The most definitive test for diagnosing meningitis is a lumbar puncture, where a needle is inserted into the lower back to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for analysis.


The CSF is examined for signs of infection, including:White blood cell count (elevated in infections)Protein levels (often elevated in meningitis)Glucose levels (typically low in bacterial meningitis)Culture and staining to identify the organism (bacteria, viruses, or fungi)

CSF analysis helps to identify the exact pathogen causing meningitis. PCR testing is more advantageous than culture for the diagnosis of infection as this technique is more rapid and can detect a variety of strains of even non-viable bacteria and antibodies against certain viruses.

6. IMAGING STUDIES
6. Imaging studies

In some cases, doctors may perform a CT scan orMRIof the brain to rule out other causes of symptoms, such as brain abscesses or swelling.
These imaging tests are especially important if the patient has signs of increased intracranial pressure (e.g., vomiting, confusion).

Note:Dilated fundus examination (DFE)plays a supportive role in the evaluation of suspected meningitis, particularly when assessing the safety of performing a lumbar puncture (LP). The procedure involves usingeye drops to dilate the pupil, allowing direct visualization of the eye fundus. The main purpose of DFE in this context is to detect papilledema, which is swelling of the optic nerve head and an important indicator of raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Elevated ICP increases the risk of brain herniation if an LP is performed without caution. Therefore, identifying papilledema can help guide whether neuroimaging is needed before proceeding with LP.

Meningitis can spread through respiratory droplets. Avoid close contact with people showing symptoms of meningitis or respiratory infections.


4. PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS
4. Prophylactic antibiotics

In cases of exposure to bacterial meningitis (e.g., close contact with an infected person), antibiotics may be given as a preventive measure.



5. TIMELY TREATMENT OF INFECTIONS
5. Timely treatment of infections

Prompt treatment of ear, respiratory, or sinus infections can help prevent bacteria from spreading to the brain and causing meningitis.

6. FOOD SAFETY MEASURES
6. Food safety measures

Listeriosis, caused by Listeria monocytogenes, can lead to meningitis, especially in high-risk groups such as pregnant women, newborns, the elderly, and individuals with weakened immune systems. To reduce the risk, follow these preventive measures:

Avoid unpasteurized dairy products: Especially soft cheeses like brie, camembert, or feta.
Cook food thoroughly:Ensure meats, poultry, and seafood are fully cooked to kill harmful bacteria. Avoid consuming raw or undercooked fish, eggs, and meats.
Wash fruits and vegetables carefully:Especially if consumed raw, to remove any potential contaminants.
Refrigerate perishable foods promptly:Avoid eating food that has been stored for too long, especially deli meats, hot dogs, or ready-to-eat products, unless they are heated until steaming hot.
Be cautious with ready-to-eat deli meats:These have a higher risk of carrying Listeria and should be handled with care.
