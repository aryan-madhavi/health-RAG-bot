INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE
Inflammatory Bowel DiseaseAlso known as IBD
OVERVIEW
Overview

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an umbrella term for two main conditionsCrohn's diseaseandulcerative colitiswhich are autoimmune disorders characterized by chronic inflammation in the digestive tract. While Crohn's disease affects the entire digestive tract, ulcerative colitis specifically targets the colon and rectum.

The inflammation hampers the normal functioning of the affected gastrointestinal organs, leading to persistent symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, weight loss,andtiredness(fatigue). IBD is a lifelong condition that has periodic flare-ups which can be severe in some cases.

Genetics, smoking, certain medications and microbial influences contribute to the risk of IBD. Dietary adjustments, stress management, and regular exercise are key lifestyle changes beneficial for managing IBD.

Treatment is based on the severity of the disease and the risk of unfavourable outcomes. IBD treatment may involve medications, and, in certain cases, surgery.

TYPES OF INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE
Types Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease


Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises two conditions (Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) characterized by persistent inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, leading to eventual damage.
1. ULCERATIVE COLITIS
1. Ulcerative colitis
It primarily affects the large intestine (colon) and the rectum.
Only the innermost layer of the colon's lining is inflamed in ulcerative colitis. The ulcers that develop on the inner lining of the colon have a tendency to bleed and form pus.
Damaged areas in ulcerative colitis are continuous (rather than patchwork), commonly beginning in the rectum and expanding into the colon.


2. CROHN'S DISEASE
2. Crohn's disease
It can affect any part of the digestive system, from the mouth to the anus.
Inflammation in Crohn's disease can cause inflammation to spread through the various layers of the GI tract's walls.
Crohn's disease causes damaged tissues to form in patches close to healthy tissue.
SYMPTOMS OF INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE
Symptoms Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease

Diarrhea associated with blood or mucusConstipationThe urgency to have a bowel movementFecal incontinence (passing stool at unexpected times)Stomach painNauseaandvomitingJoint painRashes, ulcers, and sores on the skinRedness, pain in the eyes and blurred vision.Painful sores in the mouth

Note:Iron deficiency anemia is common in IBD. Individuals who have IBD often experience iron deficiency anemia (IDA) as a result of ongoing blood loss along with hindered absorption of iron caused by inflammation in the tissues.

Listen to our expert talk about iron deficiency anemia.

CAUSES OF INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE
Causes Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease


Although the specific origin of IBD is unknown, it is believed to be a combination of genetic predisposition, viral, immunological, nutritional, and environmental variables.


In patients who have a genetic susceptibility to IBD, the body's immunological (defense) system may be activated. In most cases, the immune system defends the body against illnesses caused by viruses or bacteria (germs). Once the virus has been eradicated, that element of the immune system "shuts down" until it is required again.

However, in IBD patients, the immune system may overreact to typical microorganisms in the digestive system. When the immune system is activated, it does not shut down when it should. This causes inflammation, which harms the digestive system over time.Did you know?
IBD tends to run in families. However, not everyone with IBD has a family history of the disease. Although diet and stress might exacerbate symptoms, they are unlikely to be direct causes of Inflammatory bowel disease.
RISK FACTORS FOR INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE
Risk Factors For Inflammatory Bowel Disease


1. GENETIC PREDISPOSITION
1. Genetic predisposition
IBD can run in families. You would have a higher chance of acquiring Inflammatory bowel disease if you have a close relative who suffers from the same.

2. GUT MICROBIOTA
2. Gut microbiota
Alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota (the community of microorganisms living in the intestines) have been observed in individuals with IBD.

3. AGE
3. Age
IBD can manifest at any point in life, although it is more commonly diagnosed before or around the age of 30.

4. AUTO-IMMUNITY
4. Auto-immunity
IBD involves the immune system that mistakenly attacks healthy cells in the gut, causing chronic inflammation and symptoms.

5.STRESS
5.Stress
Stress is believed to initiate or reactivate inflammation in the gastrointestinal system, contributing to the worsening of clinical symptoms associated with IBD.

10.APPENDICITIS/APPENDECTOMY
10.Appendicitis/appendectomy
Studies suggest that individuals who have their appendix removed are less likely to develop ulcerative colitis later in life, but they may be more likely to develop Crohn's disease.

11. POOR DIETARY CHOICES
11. Poor dietary choices
Poor dietary habits such as excessive consumption of fast food, sugar, omega-6 fatty acids, trans fats, processed meat and a lower fiber diet, etc. have also been associated with an increased risk of developing Crohn’s disease.

Note:IBD or Crohn’s disease are not triggered by eating any one particular food. But for some people, certain foods can aggravate the symptoms.

12. PERINATAL (EARLY LIFE) FACTORS
12. Perinatal (early life) factors
Early events in childhood like how you're fed, hygiene at home, infections around birth, and vaccinations might affect the development of inflammatory bowel disease.
DIAGNOSIS OF INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE
Diagnosis Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease

A combination of tests and procedures will be required to help confirm an IBD diagnosis, that include:

1. MEDICAL HISTORY AND SYMPTOMS
1. Medical history and symptoms
It consists of checking the following:

If you have IBD (Crohn's or colitis) in your family, such as a grandmother, parent, sibling, or child,
If you smoke (past or present)
If you have had prior hospitalization or operation
If you are on any medications (for example, antibiotics and hormonal medications like oral contraceptives)
If you have other illnesses (for example, colorectal disease, celiac disease, and arthritis)
If you have had any prior infection with Clostridium difficile (C. difficile or C. diff)

2. BLOOD TESTS
2. Blood testsComplete blood count (CBC):This test measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. Low red blood cell count (anemia) and elevated white blood cell count can indicate inflammation.

C-reactive protein (CRP):CRP is a marker of inflammation in the body. Elevated CRP levels in the blood suggest ongoing inflammation, which is common in IBD.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR):It measures how quickly red blood cells settle at the bottom of a test tube. Higher rates can indicate inflammation.

Antibody tests:This test is used to differentiate between Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. It tests for antibodies like anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA).

3.STOOL TEST
3.Stool test
This analysis detects the presence of bacteria or parasites, particularly beneficial in excluding infections that contribute to persistent diarrhea. A type of stool test done particularly for IBD is

Fecal calprotectin:This stool test measures the presence of calprotectin, a protein released during inflammation. Elevated levels suggest intestinal inflammation and can help differentiate between IBD and other conditions.

4. ENDOSCOPIC PROCEDURES
4. Endoscopic procedures
Endoscopy, and colonoscopy:These are invasive tests in which a probe is inserted via the mouth (endoscopy) or the rectum (colonoscopy) to visualize the inner structures of the digestive tract in real-time. It provides IBD specialists with a direct look at the gastric mucosa of the intestinal tract.
Capsule endoscopy:In capsule endoscopy, a capsule is swallowed containing a tiny camera which then travels through your digestive system taking pictures and allowing the doctor to visualize inside the digestive tract.

5.  IMAGING TECHNIQUES
5.  Imaging techniques
Abdominal X-ray:It is performed in suspected cases of IBD to visualize inflammation, structural changes, and complications in the intestines
Ultrasound:It can aid in diagnosing IBD by visualizing the intestines, detecting inflammation, and assessing complications without using radiation.
Barium X-rays and fluoroscopy:For the procedure, you will be requested to position yourself in front of an X-ray machine and ingest barium. The barium will enhance the visibility of your upper GI tract on the X-ray images to detect the changes.
CT scan:Computed tomography, employs a machine to capture a sequence of X-rays in order to create an image of the digestive tract to czech for signs of inflammation.
Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE):MRE is a diagnostic imaging test that generates detailed pictures of your small intestine and helps in the diagnosis of IBD.

6. BIOPSY
6. Biopsy
Bio[sies of the colon can be taken to confirm the diagnosis. This technique is very effective in diagnosing the disease and in differentiating the type of inflammation.

3. SURGICAL TREATMENT
3. Surgical treatment
Even with medicines, many people will need surgery to treat IBD (including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis)
I. Surgical treatments for Crohn's disease

Proctocolectomy and colectomy:Colectomy is a surgical treatment that removes part or all of the large intestine, also known as the colon. If the rectum has been affected by inflammation, a surgeon may remove it as well, a technique known as proctocolectomy.


Stricturoplasty:It is a surgical procedure used when the intestines have strictures (narrowing). Instead of removing the restricted segment, the surgeon makes longitudinal incisions in the stricture and then stitches them.


Limited bowel resection:This normally entails removing only the affected bowel to relieve the problems caused by the diseased segment of the bowel.


Bowel diversion with an ostomy:This entails redirecting stool flow through the colon by cutting the intestine above the severely damaged bowel and bringing it to the skin surface via an ostomy (surgical procedure).

II. Surgical treatments for ulcerative colitis

Proctocolectomy with end-ileostomy:This procedure removes the colon, rectum, and anus completely. It is mainly reserved for patients suffering from severe ulcerative colitis.


Total colectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA):This procedure includes creating an internal pouch from a piece of the small intestine (ileum). The pouch is then attached to the anus, allowing bowel motions.


Total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis:The large intestine is removed with a straight link between the end of the small bowel and the anus, with no pouch created.
HOME CARE FOR INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE
