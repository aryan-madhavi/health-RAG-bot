BACTERIAL SKIN INFECTIONS
Bacterial skin infections
OVERVIEW
Overview
Bacterial skin infections are common and caused by a wide variety of bacteria. The two most common bacteria involved are Staphylococcus aureus and group A streptococci. Symptoms vary depending on the type of infection. However, redness, pain, swelling, and liquid discharge from a wound are usually seen in all kinds of infections.

It's important to note that any break in the skin due tocuts and punctures, injury, and skin conditions such aseczemaincreases the risk of bacterial skin infection. Moreover, individuals with long-termdiabetesandobesityare particularly vulnerable to these infections.

Some preventive measures include adequate wound care, avoiding bathing in open sources with a wound and maintaining proper hand hygiene.

Most bacterial skin infections resolve on their own, provided proper care is taken of the wound. Severe cases may require medical evaluation and appropriate treatment. Timely management helps avoid complications.

SYMPTOMS OF BACTERIAL SKIN INFECTIONS
Symptoms Of Bacterial skin infections

The symptoms of bacterial skin infections vary depending on the type and severity of the infection. The general symptoms include:
Erythema (redness of the affected area)
Pain
Warmth
Swelling
Liquidy discharge from a wound
Swelling of lymph nodes

Erythema may not be much visible in individuals with a darker skin tone.
Some bacterial skin infections can progress at a speedy rate. The severe infection may also lead to:
Fever
Chills
Increase in heart rate
Altered mental status
Blisters on the skin that are filled with clear fluid
Crepitus (unusual crackling sensation while palpating the skin)
CAUSES OF BACTERIAL SKIN INFECTIONS
Causes Of Bacterial skin infections

The skin provides the primary protection against environmental exposures. Bacteria that disrupt this protective barrier cause bacterial skin infections.

Several bacteria cause skin infections. However, most of the infections are caused by the following:
Group A Streptococcus (GAS), often called "strep."
Staphylococcus aureus, commonly called "staph."

Other bacteria include:
Corynebacterium species
Neisseria species
Haemophilus species
Helicobacter pylori
Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis
Mycoplasma pneumonia
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Calymmatobacterium granulomatis
TYPES OF BACTERIAL SKIN INFECTIONS
Types Of Bacterial skin infections

Bacterial skin infections are of several types. The most commonly found types include:

CELLULITIS
Cellulitis
It refers to an infection of deep skin. The affected area becomes painful and swollen with asymmetrical borders. The most common areas involved are legs and arms. Other sites, such as the face, feet, hands, torso, neck, and buttocks, can also be involved.

ERYSIPELAS
Erysipelas
It is a form of cellulitis that usually affects the upper layer of the skin. It involves fiery red, painful infection with sharply demarcated borders. The common sites are the legs and face.

IMPETIGO
Impetigo
It usually appears as reddish sores on the face, especially around the nose and mouth. Sores can also appear on hands and feet. It is more commonly seen in children aged 2 to 5 years.

FOLLICULITIS
Folliculitis
Folliculitis is an inflammation of the hair follicles. Individuals with folliculitis often experience pus-filled lesions on the skin.

FURUNCLE (BOILS)
Furuncle (boils)
It refers to the severe form of folliculitis in which the infection progresses deeper and extends out from the follicle. The infection starts as painful lesions filled with pus. The most common affected areas are the neck, armpits, thighs, and buttocks.

CARBUNCLE
Carbuncle
This is also the progressed form of folliculitis. In this, an aggregate of hair follicles develops. These aggregates form large swollen lesions that often open and discharge.
All of the above infections are usually caused by Streptococcus or Staphylococcus species.
RISK FACTORS FOR BACTERIAL SKIN INFECTIONS
Risk Factors For Bacterial skin infections

Any factor that allows bacteria to get through the skin increases the chances of bacterial skin infection:

1. INJURIES
1. Injuries
Skin injuries allow the bacteria to enter the deeper tissues through skin breaks. These injuries can result from the following:
Scrapes
Wounds
Punctures
Surgery
Burns
Sunburns
Insect bites
Ulcers
Tattoos
Piercings
Preexisting skin diseases

Bacteria can also invade the skin through hair follicles on the skin surface.

2. MEDICAL CONDITIONS
2. Medical conditions
Individuals with chronic skin conditions such as athlete's foot,eczema,chickenpox, and shingles are at increased risk of developing bacterial skin infections.

3. REPEATED INJECTIONS
3. Repeated Injections
The repetitive use of injections also makes an individual prone to bacterial skin infections.

4.OBESITY
4.Obesity
Due to increased fat, the skin of obese individuals has more significant skin folds. This makes the skin prone to bacterial growth, which may lead to infection.

5.EDEMA
5.Edema
Persistent swelling, especially in the arms and legs, can crack the skin. This may allow bacteria to enter beneath the skin, causing a skin infection.

6.DIABETES
6.Diabetes
The complications of diabetes can cause cracks in the superficial layer of the skin and skin breakdown, which increases the chances of bacterial skin infection. The commonly observed bacterial skin infections in diabetics include cellulitis, folliculitis, impetigo, carbuncle, and furuncle.

7.LOW IMMUNITY
7.Low immunity
Individuals who have low immunity are at higher risk of bacterial skin infections. This includes:
Elderly people
Individuals undergoing chemotherapy
Individuals taking any medication that suppresses the immune system
People withHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection

Here are ten ways to boost the immune system.

DIAGNOSIS OF BACTERIAL SKIN INFECTIONS
Diagnosis Of Bacterial skin infections

Most diagnoses of bacterial skin infections are made through physical examination.
The following laboratory tests are used to determine the type of infection and assess complications in cases of severe clinical symptoms:

1. BLOOD TESTS
1. Blood tests
Complete blood count:A persistent bacterial infection often causes a rise in the white blood cell count, which is determined through a complete blood cell count. The test also helps to distinguish a bacterial infection from a viral infection.

Here is the complete information about the CBC test.
Tap to Know

C-reactive protein (CRP):CRP is an inflammatory marker whose level increases during an infection. The detectable rise in CRP can take up to 24 hours after the onset of symptoms.
Procalcitoninis a type of protein released by various cells after a serious bacterial infection. An elevated level of procalcitonin may be a sign of sepsis.

2. SKIN CULTURE
2. Skin culture
It involves examining a sample of skin, tissue, or exudates taken from the infected site. This test detects the type of microbes causing the infection and helps guide the right treatment plan.

2. DO NOT IGNORE ANY BREAK IN THE SKIN
2. Do not ignore any break in the skin
Any puncture or break in the skin should not be ignored. It should be immediately consulted with the doctor. This helps prevent the growth of bacteria that may otherwise lead to skin infection.

3. PROTECT WOUNDS AND INFECTIONS
3. Protect wounds and infections
Individuals with open wounds or skin infections should avoid hot tubs, swimming pools, and other water bodies such as lakes, rivers, and oceans. This also prevents them from bacterial skin infections.

4. MAINTAIN HAND HYGIENE
4. Maintain hand hygiene
Sometimes, unknown cuts can spread the infection to others. It is always advisable to wash your hands more often, especially after coughing and sneezing. Hand hygiene should also be maintained before preparing foods and during eating.

5. MAINTAIN A HEALTHY SKIN BARRIER
5. Maintain a healthy skin barrier
The skin barrier should be maintained through timely management of skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and eczema. Any allergen or irritant to the skin should be avoided.

6. GO FOR A SKIN EXAMINATION
6. Go for a skin examination
Individuals with diabetes or obesity should have their skin screened regularly. People with diabetes should also check their feet daily for signs of injury or infection. Early management can help prevent infection.Did you know?
