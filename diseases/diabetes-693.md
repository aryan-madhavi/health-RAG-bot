DIABETES
DiabetesDiabetes mellitus, Hyperglycemia, and High blood sugar
OVERVIEW
Overview
Diabetes mellitus, also commonly known as diabetes, is a long-term metabolic disorder that causes high levels of glucose (fasting >126 mg/dl and/or post-prandial>200 mg/dl) in the blood. It occurs when the pancreas – which produces the hormone insulin – either fails to produce (any or enough) insulin or fails to use it to keep the blood glucose in control effectively.

Diabetes has two main types: Type 1, often seen in children and young people, and Type 2, which affects adults of all ages. Another form,gestational diabetesmellitus (GDM), occurs during pregnancy and impacts many women worldwide.

Symptoms include frequent urination, excessive thirst, fatigue, blurred vision, and slow wound healing. Risk factors include genetics,obesity, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, andhypertension (high blood pressure). Gestational diabetes risk increases with pregnancy-related hormonal changes.

Diabetes management includes lifestyle changes, oral medications, and some injectables. Effective care requires a lifelong commitment to a healthy lifestyle, timely medication, and regular checkups to prevent complications.

CAUSES OF DIABETES
Causes Of Diabetes

Diabetes is caused by the body's inability to produce enough insulin or use insulin effectively. The cause mainly depends on the types which include:
TYPE 1 DIABETES
Type 1 diabetes
It is known to be caused due to an autoimmune reaction in which the immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas and leads to destruction.
As a result, there is very little or no insulin production, which affects the blood glucose control.
Even though it can develop at any age, it occurs most commonly in children and young people.

TYPE 2 DIABETES
Type 2 diabetes
It is caused by the body's inability to respond properly to insulin, leading to insulin resistance.
This causes the hormone insulin to be ineffective, which in turn, causes the body to produce more insulin.
As a result, the pancreas fails to keep up the body’s demand for more insulin.
This gradually causes inadequate production of insulin leading to high blood glucose.

OTHER TYPES OF DIABETES
Other Types Of Diabetes

Apart from Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes, there are other forms you should be aware of. These include:
Prediabetes:It is a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not yet high enough for a diabetes diagnosis.

Prediabetes can be your body’s call to act and make some lifestyle changes. Know more about what you can do to stop the progression from prediabetes to diabetes.

Gestational diabetes:It is defined as diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy that affects a significant proportion of pregnant women worldwide. Women usually develop gestational diabetes between the second or third trimester of pregnancy.


Monogenic diabetes:As the name implies,monogenic diabetes results from a single gene rather than the contributions of multiple genes and environmental factors as seen in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It is much less common and often misdiagnosed as either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. These monogenic forms present a broad spectrum from neonatal diabetes mellitus (or ‘monogenic diabetes of infancy’), maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), and rare diabetes-associated syndromic diseases.Did you know?
Drug or chemical-induced diabetes. Yes, as the name suggests, this is a type of diabetes that is caused due to drugs or chemicals.  For example, after usage of immunosuppressive drugs in organ transplant patients, following HIV/AIDS treatment, water pills or steroids.

RISK FACTORS FOR DIABETES
Risk Factors For Diabetes


Depending upon the type, there are several risk factors for diabetes. These include:


1. TYPE 1 DIABETES
1. Type 1 diabetes
Although there are not many risk factors of type 1 diabetes, some factors that are known to up the risk include:Presence of certain types of genesEnvironmental triggers or a virus (any sort of infection or bacteria), which can initiate an autoimmune reactionPresence of autoantibodies (antibodies that mistakenly attack your own body’s tissues or organs)Geographic location (certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes)Family history of diabetes
2. TYPE 2 DIABETES

2. Type 2 diabetesObesitySmokingFamily history of diabetesFamily history of high cholesterol,hypertension (high blood pressure), or cardiovascular diseaseHaving a sedentary lifestyleSuffering frompolycystic ovarian syndrome(PCOS)Suffering from prediabetesBeing pregnantRecurrent wounds/ulcers, which fail to healStressHistory of diabetes in pregnancyHistory of impaired glucose tolerance.


3. GESTATIONAL DIABETES
3. Gestational diabetesBMI (Body Mass Index) that exceeds 30Excessive weight gain during pregnancyFamily history of diabetes during pregnancyHistory of giving birth to a baby weighing 4.5kg or moreExpecting more than one babyFamily history of hypertensionHistory of miscarriage or stillbirthHistory of conditions related to insulin resistance or PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome)History of habitual smokingGiving birth to a child with congenital abnormalityDid you know?
Smokers are 30–40% more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes than non-smokers, and smoking makes blood sugar harder to control, increasing the risk of complications.

DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES
Diagnosis Of DiabetesTimely diagnosis of diabetes is crucial for preventing complications, as early detection allows for better management and lifestyle adjustments. Tests include:
1.RANDOM BLOOD SUGAR TEST
1.Random blood sugar testThis test is done to measure the levels of glucose circulating in the blood. It measures blood glucose levels at any time of the day, helping to diagnose diabetes without requiring fasting.The values for random blood glucose tests are as follows:Normal:Less than 140 mg/dlPrediabetes:Between 140 and 200 mg/dlDiabetes:Greater than or equal to 200 mg/dlPregnant women:Greater than or equal to 200 mg/dl
2.FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE TEST (FPGT)

2.Fasting plasma glucose test (FPGT)It is a blood test that measures the levels of glucose in the blood in the fasting state (empty stomach). Ideally, it is advised to not eat or drink anything (except water) for 8-12 hours before the test. The values for FBS are as follows:Normal:Less than 100 mg/dlPrediabetes:Between 100 mg/dl to 125 mg/dlDiabetes:Greater than or equal to126 mg/dlPregnant women:Between 90-140 mg/dl
3.POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE (PPBG) TEST

3.Postprandial blood glucose (PPBG) test
It is performed to measure glucose levels in the blood after 2 hours from the start of the last meal. The values for PPBG are as follows:Normal:Less than 140 mg/dlImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes):Between 140 and 200 mg/dlDiabetes:Equal to or above 200 mg/dl
4.HEMOGLOBIN A1C (HBA1C) TEST
4.Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testIt is a blood test that measures a person’s average blood glucose level over the past 2 to 3 months. It is ideally used to check how well your diabetes is managed with medication. The values for HbA1c are as follows:Normal:Less than 5.7%Prediabetes:Between 5.7% to 6.4%Diabetes:Greater than or equal to 6.5%Pregnant women:Between 6% to 6.5%
5. ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST (OGTT)
5. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)The test is used to check the blood glucose levels before and 2 hours after you have a sweet drink (which in most cases is a glucose solution). The test tells your doctor how well your body processes the glucose (sugar) which in turn aids in the diagnosis of diabetes. The values for OGTT are as follows:Normal:Less than 140 mg/dlPrediabetes:140 mg/dl to 199 mg/dlDiabetes:200 mg/dl or higherPregnant women:200 mg/dL or higher

TREATMENT OF DIABETES
Treatment Of Diabetes
Diabetes can be treated with medications and injections along with a few lifestyle modifications. Some of the common types of medicines for diabetes include:
1. ORAL MEDICATIONS
1. Oral medications
Biguanides:These drugs help control blood sugar by reducing the liver’s sugar production, lowering sugar absorption in the gut, and making the body more responsive to insulin.Metforminis generally the first medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes.

Sulphonylureas:These drugs are known to increase the secretion of insulin by the pancreas to manage diabetes. Some of the common examples includeGlimepirideandGlipizide.

Thiazolidinediones:This class of drugs helps control diabetes by increasing insulin sensitivity in the muscles and fat tissues. Examples of this class of drug includePioglitazone.

Meglitinides:These increase the secretion of insulin by the pancreas to treat diabetes. Examples of this class of drugs areRepaglinideandNateglinide.

Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors:This class of drugs inhibits the enzyme alpha-glucosidase thereby decreasing the absorption of glucose by the intestine. Some of the commonly available drugs includeAcarboseandMiglitol.

DPP-4 inhibitors:It works by improving the secretion of insulin by the pancreas thereby helping in the treatment of diabetes. Examples areSitagliptinandSaxagliptin.

Incretin mimetics:This class of oral antidiabetics is known to increase the secretion of the hormone insulin and help in controlling diabetes. Commonly used drugs areLiraglutideandDulaglutide.

2. INSULIN INJECTIONS
2. Insulin Injections
This includes insulin (mainlyhuman insulin) which increases the uptake of glucose by the cells and helps to control diabetes. There are 5 different types of insulin available currently which are recommended based on the severity of the condition. These include:

Rapid-acting insulin(Examples:Insulin lispro,Insulin glulisine, etc)
Short-acting insulin (Examples: Insulin regular and Semilente)
Intermediate-acting insulin(Examples: Insulin lente,Insulin isophane, etc)
Long-acting insulin (Examples: Ultralente, Protamine Zinc)
Ultra-long-acting Insulin(Examples:Insulin glargine,Insulin detemir,Insulin degludec, etc)

3. INSULIN PUMPS
3. Insulin pumps
Insulin pumps are small-sized computer devices that deliver small doses of short-acting insulin continuously, just like how the pancreas works.
It provides a steady flow through day and night. All you need to do is attach it to your body using an infusion set.


4. TRANSPLANTS
4. Transplants
For some people who have type 1 diabetes, a pancreas transplant may be an option.
Islet transplants are being studied as well.
With a successful pancreas transplant, you would no longer need insulin therapy, but transplants aren't always successful.


5. BARIATRIC SURGERY
5. Bariatric surgery
Also known as weight loss surgery, it helps to cut down the fat through surgery.
Although it is not specifically considered a treatment for type 2 diabetes, people with type 2 diabetes who are may benefit from this surgery.
