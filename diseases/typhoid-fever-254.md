TYPHOID FEVER
Typhoid feverAlso known as Typhoid fever and Enteric fever
OVERVIEW
Overview
Typhoid fever is a serious infectious disease caused by the Salmonella Typhi bacteria. It spreads primarily through contaminated food and water or close contact with an infected person.

Common symptoms include prolonged highfever, weakness, stomach pain,headache,and loss of appetite; in severe cases, it may lead to intestinal complications.

Typhoid is most prevalent in regions with poor sanitation and limited access to clean water, especially in parts of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Preventative measures include proper sanitation, safe food practices, and vaccination.

Diagnosis is usually confirmed through blood or stool tests. Typhoid fever is treated with antibiotics, and a timely treatment ensures quick recovery in most cases. However, early detection and appropriate medical care are vital to prevent severe illness and complications.

SYMPTOMS OF TYPHOID
Symptoms of Typhoid

Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection that primarily affects the intestines. Symptoms typically appear 10–14 days after exposure and develop gradually. The onset is often subtle but can become severe if left untreated.

The hallmark symptom of typhoid is prolonged highfever, which has a distinctive pattern:
The fever develops slowly over several days, unlike the sudden spikes seen in other infections.It rises in a stepwise fashion, increasing a little each day until it peaks.The temperature may climb as high as 104.9°F (40.5°C).Once established, the fever remains consistently high and is typically continuous, not intermittent.Without treatment, the fever may persist for several days to weeks.


Other common signs and symptoms that may accompany fever include:HeadacheAbdominal painTirednessand weaknessMuscle achesLoss of appetiteConstipationor diarrheaConfusionLow pulse rateRose-colored spots on the neck, chest, or abdomenSwollen abdomen


As the illness progresses, some patients may enter the "typhoid state"—a condition marked by extreme exhaustion, where the person lies still withhalf-closed eyesand shows minimal responsiveness.

If untreated, typhoid can lead to life-threatening complications such as intestinal perforation and internal bleeding.
CAUSES OF TYPHOID
Causes Of Typhoid

Typhoid fever is caused by the bacterium Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (commonly known as Salmonella Typhi).
How is typhoid fever transmitted?
1. FECAL-ORAL ROUTE (PRIMARY CAUSE)
1. Fecal-oral route (primary cause)
Typhoid fever is most commonly spread through the fecal-oral route, meaning the bacteria are passed in the feces of an infected person and then ingested by another person.

This can happen when a person eats food or drinks water that has been contaminated with feces or urine from someone infected with Salmonella Typhi.


2. CONTAMINATED FOOD AND WATER
2. Contaminated food and water


Typhoid fever is primarily spread through contaminated food and water, particularly in regions with poor sanitation. Common sources include:
Contaminated water:Drinking untreated water or consuming food prepared with it.Raw or undercooked food:Often from regions with inadequate food safety standards.Ice:Made from untreated or contaminated water.Raw fruits and vegetables:Washed with contaminated water or grown in contaminated soil.Street food and unpasteurized dairy:Common in endemic areas with poor hygiene practices.

3. POOR HYGIENE AND SANITATION
3. Poor hygiene and sanitation

Poor sanitation, such as the absence of clean toilets or sewage systems, increases the likelihood of contamination.
Improper hand hygiene, especially after using the toilet or handling food, can lead to the spread of bacteria.


4. CLOSE CONTACT WITH INFECTED INDIVIDUALS
4. Close contact with infected individuals

Close contact with an infected person, especially in crowded or unsanitary environments, can spread the bacteria.
People who are chronic carriers (those who have had typhoid fever but continue to shed the bacteria in their stool or urine) can unknowingly spread the infection to others.
RISK FACTORS FOR TYPHOID
Risk Factors For Typhoid

There are certain factors that can increase the risk of typhoid fever. These include:

LIVING IN OR TRAVELING TO ENDEMIC AREAS
Living in or traveling to endemic areas
Typhoid is most common in areas with poor sanitation and limited access to clean water, including parts of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.


POOR SANITATION AND HYGIENE
Poor sanitation and hygiene
Areas lacking proper sewage systems, clean water, and hygienic food handling are at high risk.
People living in environments with inadequate sanitation are more likely to be exposed.


CONTAMINATED WATER AND FOOD SOURCES
Contaminated water and food sources
Unclean drinking water, particularly in rural or underdeveloped areas, is a major risk factor.
Consumption of raw or undercooked food, especially from street vendors or restaurants with poor food handling practices, increases risk.


CLOSE CONTACT WITH INFECTED INDIVIDUALS
Close contact with infected individuals
Household contacts or caregivers of someone who has active typhoid fever or is a chronic carrier of the bacteria.
People who have had typhoid but continue to shed the bacteria in their urine or stool without symptoms (asymptomatic carriers) can unknowingly spread it.

OVERCROWDED LIVING CONDITIONS
Overcrowded living conditions
Living in overcrowded conditions with shared toilets (e.g., slums or refugee camps) increases exposure risk.

CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS
Children and young adults
Children are at higher risk, as they are more likely to engage in poor hygiene practices.
Young adults traveling to endemic areas may also face increased exposure.


IMMUNOCOMPROMISED INDIVIDUALS
Immunocompromised individuals
People with weakened immune systems (due to conditions like HIV/AIDS, cancer, or immunosuppressive treatments) are more susceptible to infections like typhoid.

HEALTH CARE WORKERS
Health care workers
Healthcare workers are at high risk of typhoid due to close contact with infected patients, handling contaminated medical equipment, and exposure to fecal matter in environments with inadequate sanitation and hygiene.

DIAGNOSIS OF TYPHOID
Diagnosis Of Typhoid


Typhoid fever is diagnosed through a combination of clinical evaluation and laboratory tests to detect the presence of Salmonella Typhi bacteria.

1. CLINICAL EVALUATION
1. Clinical evaluation
Doctors begin by asking about your symptoms and performing a physical examination. Signs like abdominal tenderness, enlarged liver or spleen, swollen lymph nodes, and a rash called rose spots may be present. However, these signs can look similar to other illnesses, so lab tests are essential for confirming typhoid fever.

2. LABORATORY TESTS
2. Laboratory tests
a) Blood cultureThis is the most reliable in the first week of illness. It detects the presence of Salmonella Typhi in the bloodstream.


b) Widal test
This test is done in two ways:Widal slide agglutinationandWidal tube agglutination.
It detects antibodies (agglutinins) against S. Typhi.
While this test is widely used, but less specific and prone to false positives/negatives.


c) Stool and urine culture
May detect the bacteria after the first week of illness.
It is useful in identifying chronic carriers.


d) Bone marrow culture
The most sensitive test, especially when antibiotics have already started.
It can detect bacteria even in late stages of illness.

e)Typhidot test
It is a rapid serological test used to detect antibodies against Salmonella Typhi.
IgM antibodies indicate recent or current infection, while IgG antibodies suggest past exposure or infection.
Useful for early diagnosis, even before cultures become positive.



3. IMAGING TESTS
3. Imaging tests
If complications are suspected, anUltrasound or CT scanmay help detect intestinal perforation, abscesses, or hepatosplenomegaly (enlarged liver/spleen).

COMPLICATIONS OF TYPHOID
Complications of Typhoid

Typhoid fever, if left untreated or inadequately treated, can lead to several serious complications. Here are some of the complications associated with typhoid fever:

Intestinal perforation:One of the most serious complications, it occurs when the bacteria cause ulceration in the intestinal walls, leading to a hole or perforation. This can result in the leakage of intestinal contents into the abdominal cavity, causing peritonitis (infection of the lining of the abdominal cavity).


Internal bleeding:Ulceration caused by the bacteria can lead to bleeding in the intestines.
It can result in significant blood loss and, in severe cases, shock.


Sepsis:The bacteria Salmonella Typhi can enter the bloodstream, leading to a systemic infection known as sepsis. Sepsis can lead to organ failure, shock, and death if not treated immediately.


Neurological complications:In rare cases, typhoid fever can causeencephalitis(inflammation of the brain) or other neurological symptoms. This can lead to confusion, delirium, and even coma.


Liver or gallbladder issues:Typhoid fever can cause liver inflammation or gallbladder issues. Inflammation may lead tojaundice(yellowing of the skin and eyes).


Kidney problems:Typhoid fever can affect kidney function, leading to acutekidney failurein severe cases.


Pneumoniaand respiratory issues:Typhoid fever can also cause pneumonia, particularly in older adults or those with weakened immune systems.


Heart problems:In rare cases, the infection may affect the heart, causing inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or infection of the heart lining (endocarditis).

Bone and joint complications:Bone complications of typhoid fever, though rare, include osteomyelitis and septic arthritis. These occur when Salmonella Typhi spreads to bones or joints, leading to pain, swelling, and potential long-term damage.Did you know?
Some individuals continue to carrySalmonella Typhiin their bodies even after recovering from typhoid fever. Thesechronic carriersshow no symptoms but still shed the bacteria in their stool, potentially spreading the infection to others. They pose a significant public health risk due to their ability to unknowingly transmit the disease.Did our information help you?In our relentless endeavour to keep improving our services, you are our eyes.
