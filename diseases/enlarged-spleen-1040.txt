ENLARGED SPLEEN
Enlarged SpleenAlso known as Splenomegaly
OVERVIEW
Overview

The spleen is an organ in the upper left of the abdomen that helps filter blood and supports the immune system. Splenomegaly is the medical term for an enlarged spleen, which can result from infections, liver diseases, or blood disorders.

An enlarged spleen can cause symptoms like pain or fullness in the left upper abdomen and a feeling of fullness without eating. Conditions that increase blood cell destruction, like hemolytic anemia, can also predispose people to splenomegaly.

Management of an enlarged spleen often involves treating the underlying cause, such as antibiotics for infections or medications for liver disease. In severe cases, where the spleen poses a risk of rupture or causes significant symptoms, a surgical procedure called a splenectomy may be considered to remove the spleen.

SYMPTOMS OF ENLARGED SPLEEN
Symptoms Of Enlarged Spleen

Usually, an enlarged spleen does not exhibit any observable signs or symptoms but sometimes it may result in:

Discomfort in the upper left abdomen may radiate to your left shoulder or back.
A feeling of fullness even without eating or after consuming a small quantity, as the spleen exerts pressure on the stomach
Reduced red blood cells lead to anemia
Frequent infections
Increased susceptibility to bleeding

Pay attention to all of these signs. Get professional advice from specialists for prompt diagnosis and tailored care.

CAUSES OF ENLARGED SPLEEN
Causes Of Enlarged Spleen

The spleen helps filter old or damaged blood cells from the body. It’s essential for maintaining healthy blood cell levels.

When the spleen grows larger than normal, it can cause symptoms like stomach cramps, bloating, and discomfort in the abdomen.

In an enlarged spleen, this filtering process is disrupted. Instead of removing old blood cells, the spleen retains them, which can lead to anemia (low red blood cells) because it traps too many cells.

An enlarged spleen can also over-target white blood cells and platelets, leading to low levels of both (called leukopenia for white blood cells and thrombocytopenia for platelets).

This retention and destruction of blood cells causes the spleen to grow larger, which can worsen the cycle, leading to further complications.

RISK FACTORS FOR ENLARGED SPLEEN
Risk Factors For Enlarged Spleen

An enlarged spleen, also known as splenomegaly, can be caused by a variety of factors, including underlying medical conditions or diseases. Some risk factors associated with splenomegaly include:
1. INFECTIONS
1. Infections
Viral infections like mononucleosis andHIV.
Bacterial infections liketuberculosis and endocarditis (swelling inside the lining of the heart)
Parasite infections such asmalariaand toxoplasmosis (or people who live in or travel to areas where malaria is common)
2. LIVER DISEASES
2. Liver diseases
Conditions affecting the liver, such ascirrhosis,hepatitis, or portalhypertension, can cause increased pressure in the liver and portal vein system, leading to splenomegaly.

3. BLOOD DISORDERS

3. Blood disorders
Diseases affecting blood cells, such as leukemia, lymphoma, hemolytic anemia, orthalassemia, may result in an enlarged spleen due to increased production or destruction of blood cells.

4. AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS
4. Autoimmune disorders
Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body’s healthy cells, tissues, or organs, thinking they are harmful invaders.
It includes conditions like lupus,rheumatoid arthritis, or sarcoidosis.
5. INHERITED METABOLIC DISORDERS

5. Inherited metabolic disorders
These are disorders that affect the body's process of converting food into energy.
Metabolic conditions such as Gaucher's disease or Niemann-Pick disease can result in the accumulation of certain substances within the spleen, causing it to enlarge.
6. TRAUMA

6. Trauma
Trauma to the abdomen or spleen itself, such as a car accident or a sports injury, can lead to splenic rupture and subsequent enlargement.

7. CONGESTION
7. Congestion
Conditions causing congestion in the blood vessels around the spleen, such as congestive heart failure, can lead to splenomegaly.

8. CANCERS
8. Cancers
Blood cancers like leukemia or lymphomas.
Metastatic cancers spread to the spleen from elsewhere in the body.

9. THROMBOSIS
9. Thrombosis
Blood clots block vessels in the liver or spleen, causing pressure and blood buildup.
DIAGNOSIS OF ENLARGED SPLEEN
Diagnosis Of Enlarged Spleen

The diagnosis of an enlarged spleen typically involves these measures:
1. MEDICAL HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
1. Medical history and physical examination
The doctor inquires about symptoms, past illnesses, medications, familial medical history, recent infections, and traumas.
The physical exam checks the abdomen to feel for an enlarged spleen, though slight enlargements might not always be detectable by touch.

2. IMAGING STUDIES
2. Imaging Studies
Doctors utilize various imaging techniques to assess the condition of the spleen and surrounding structures. These include:

X-rays:Sometimes, an enlarged spleen can be incidentally detected during abdominal X-rays performed for other reasons.


Ultrasoundandcomputed tomography (CT) Scan:These imaging modalities can help identify the cause of splenomegaly and evaluate for complications such as splenic rupture or masses.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):MRI scans may be used to further evaluate an enlarged spleen, particularly in cases where CT scans are contraindicated or when additional imaging information is needed.

3. BLOOD TESTS:
3. Blood Tests:

Complete Blood Count (CBC):Abnormalities such as anemia, leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), or thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) may suggest underlying causes of splenomegaly.


Blood smear:A blood smear may be examined under a microscope to assess the morphology of blood cells and detect abnormalities that could indicate specific conditions such as infections, hemolytic anemias, or blood cancers.


Liver function tests(LFT):Liver function tests may be performed to evaluate liver function and assess for liver diseases that can contribute to splenomegaly, such as cirrhosis or hepatitis.


4. BIOPSY
4. Biopsy
In some cases, a biopsy of the spleen may be recommended to obtain a tissue sample for further evaluation.
This is typically performed using a procedure called a splenectomy, where a portion or the entire spleen is removed surgically.
In some cases, a bone marrow biopsy may be necessary to detect blood cell cancers or storage diseases.
