SMELLY FEET
Smelly feetAlso known as Foot odor, Stinky feet, and Bromodosis
OVERVIEW
Overview
Smelly feet are a common foot condition. Sweating in the feet creates a moist environment that allows bacteria to thrive. These bacteria then break down the sweat into acids, resulting in an unpleasant odor.


Factors such as excessive sweating, poor foot hygiene, bacterial or fungal infections, and certain health conditions like diabetes and hormonal changes can increase the risk of this problem.


Prevention of smelly feet consists of practicing good foot hygiene. Make sure to wash your feet daily, using an antibacterial soap. Ensure thorough drying, especially between the toes. Prefer wearing breathable shoes and socks. Foot powders and topical antiperspirants can be used to manage excessive moisture and odor.

However, foot odor is usually not associated with any physical discomfort or pain.
CAUSES OF SMELLY FEET

Smelly feet are primarily caused by the interaction between sweat and bacteria on the skin of the feet.

DIAGNOSIS OF SMELLY FEET
Diagnosis Of Smelly Feet

Smelly feet, or foot odor, are typically diagnosed based on the characteristic smell and the presence of other associated symptoms. Diagnosing the exact root cause of smelly feet involves a combination of the following:
1. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
1. Physical examination
Your doctor will visually inspect your feet to look for signs of bacterial or fungal infections, such as redness, scaling, or peeling skin. They may also check for signs of excessive sweating or other foot-related issues.
2. STARCH-IODINE TEST
2. Starch-iodine test
This test entails applying an iodine solution to the feet and then sprinkling cornstarch on them. If there is a significant amount of sweat, the treated area will become dark blue.
3. LABORATORY TESTS
3. Laboratory tests
In some cases, additional tests may be recommended to rule out underlying medical conditions or to confirm the presence of a fungal infection. These tests may include:
Fungal culture:If a fungal infection is suspected, a sample of the affected skin may be collected and sent to a laboratory for culture and identification of the specific fungus.
Skin swab or scraping:A swab or scraping of the affected area may be taken to check for bacterial overgrowth or to identify the specific bacteria present.
