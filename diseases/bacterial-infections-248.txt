BACTERIAL INFECTIONS
Bacterial infections
OVERVIEW
Overview
Bacterial infections are caused by bacteria, a kind of microorganism that is made of only one cell. Millions of bacteria are present in the environment around us, on our body and inside it. Bacteria are both useful and harmful to us. Many are beneficial, such as those involved in immunity and digestion. In fact, only a small number of bacteria are responsible for illnesses.

These harmful bacteria invade the body and multiply by challenging the body's natural defenses. They are transmitted through contact, droplets, vectors, airborne particles, or contaminated objects.

Poor hand hygiene, weak immunity, chronic health conditions, and close contact with infected individuals can increase the risk of bacterial infections.

Regular handwashing, getting vaccinated, and ensuring food safety are some of the ways to prevent bacterial infections. Treatment typically involves the use of antibiotics along with supportive measures to manage pain and fever.

The various modes by which bacterial infections may be transmitted include:
Contact:This occurs through direct skin-to-skin or mucous membrane contact. It can also happen through ingesting fecal matter or receiving contaminated blood products.
Airborne:Certain bacteria can travel through the air in droplet nuclei.
Droplets:Infections spread through droplets larger than 5 Î¼m are not classified as airborne.
Vectors:Insects like mosquitoes, ticks, or lice, feed on an infected host (human or animal) and then pass on the pathogens to another individual who is not infected
Vehicular:This is when the bacteria travels from the mouth to the intestine through contaminated inanimate objects such as food, water, and fomites.

Eye flu can be caused by bacteria as well!
Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, is the inflammation of the thin, protective membrane covering the white part of the eyeball. It can result from viral or bacterial infections. Know more about home-care tips to manage it.

2. AGE
2. Age
Very young or elderly individuals may be more susceptible to bacterial infections due to developing or declining immune systems.

3. POOR HYGIENE
3. Poor hygiene
Improper handwashing and other hygiene practices can increase the likelihood of coming into contact with harmful bacteria.


4. CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS
4. Chronic health conditions
Conditions likediabetes, cancer, lung diseases, heart conditions, etc can increase the chances of contracting bacterial infections.

5. HOSPITALIZATION
5. Hospitalization
Nosocomial infections (healthcare-associated infections) can be acquired after a stay in the hospital. They can be unrelated to the patient's initial diagnosis upon admission to the hospital.


6. RECENT SURGERY
6. Recent surgery
Medical procedures can provide a potential entry point to harmful bacteria, increasing the likelihood of bacterial infection in the postoperative period.


7. CLOSE CONTACT WITH INFECTED INDIVIDUALS
7. Close contact with infected individuals
This allows the transmission of bacteria from one person to another through respiratory droplets, physical touch, or shared surfaces, leading to potential infections.
8. OTHER FACTORS

8. Other factors
Travel to areas with high bacterial infection rates
Living in crowded or unsanitary conditions
Not following proper food safety measures.
DIAGNOSIS OF BACTERIAL INFECTIONS
Diagnosis Of Bacterial Infections

The diagnosis of bacterial infections would depend on the symptomatic history of the patient. The tests that may be done include:
1. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
1. Physical examination
This consists of assessing specific symptoms, signs, and affected areas of the body. The doctor may look for redness, swelling, warmth, or other signs of inflammation. They may check lymph nodes for enlargement, and examine the throat, ears, nose, and skin for any abnormalities. They may also take vital signs like temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate.
2. BLOOD TESTS
2. Blood tests
Several blood tests can be done to detect bacterial infections:
Complete blood count (CBC):This test assesses the number of white blood cells, specifically neutrophils, which increase in response to bacterial infections.
C-reactive protein (CRP):Elevated levels of CRP indicate inflammation, which can be a sign of bacterial infections.
Procalcitonin (PCT):High PCT levels in the blood can suggest a bacterial infection rather than a viral one.
Blood cultures:Blood samples are collected and cultured in the lab to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection.
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR):An increased ESR is a non-specific indicator of inflammation, including bacterial infections.

3. URINE CULTURE
3. Urine culture
A urine culture test can detect bacteria or yeast causing a UTI, and an antibiotic sensitivity test can determine the most effective antibiotic against those specific bacteria if they multiply.
4. GRAM STAIN TO IDENTIFY BACTERIA
4. Gram stain to identify bacteria
This helps identify different types of bacteria. When the stain interacts with bacteria, it can either remain purple or change to pink or red. If they stay purple, they are called Gram-positive, and if they turn pink or red, they are called Gram-negative.
5. NUCLEIC ACID PROBES AND POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTIONS
5. Nucleic acid probes and polymerase chain reactions
These are used to find specific genes in a sample without growing bacteria. Probes identify genes for E. coli, cholera, gonorrhea, etc.
6. OTHER TESTS
6. Other tests
Toxin assay to look for the toxins made by the bacteria
Culture or biopsy of the tissue infected.
CELEBS AFFECTED
