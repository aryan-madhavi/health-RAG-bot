COMMON COLD
Common coldAlso known as Cold and Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI)
OVERVIEW
Overview
Common cold is one of the most common ailments that every one of us might have had at some point in our lives. Although mostly caused by viruses, cold can also be triggered due to changes in weather or an underlying respiratory infection. It can spread by close contact with infected people or touching contaminated objects.

Sneezing, sore throat, feeling of being unwell, and nasal discharge are the most common symptoms associated with a cold. To diagnose a cold, assessing the physical symptoms is usually sufficient. In most cases, there is no need for any laboratory test.


Treatment of cold is mainly based on relieving the symptoms. Home care measures like steam inhalation, staying hydrated, gargling, use of nasal spray and taking adequate rest are effective in speedy recovery from the cold.
