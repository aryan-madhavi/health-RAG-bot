JET LAG
Jet lagAlso known as Jet syndrome, Travel fatigue, Circadian desynchrony, and Circadian rhythm sleep disturbances
OVERVIEW
Overview
The boon of quick air travel across continents also comes with some after-effects in the form of jet lag. Jet lag is basically a temporary sleep problem that is caused by a mismatch between a person's normal daily rhythm and the new time zone traveled to.

This disruption of the body’s internal clock can lead to symptoms like sleep disturbances, fatigue, irritability, excessive daytime sleepiness, mood disturbances, memory lapses, and physical discomfort.


Jet lag is a temporary condition that resolves in a few days and usually does not need any treatment.


General preventive and management techniques involve gradual adjustment of sleep schedules, maintaining hydration, avoiding alcohol and caffeine, and exposing oneself to natural light. For severe cases, sleep medications ormelatoninsupplements can be considered under medical guidance.

SYMPTOMS OF JET LAG
Symptoms Of Jet Lag

Jet lag is a temporary sleep disturbance that occurs while traveling across multiple time zones.
It can affect individuals differently, and the severity of symptoms can vary depending on factors like the number of time zones crossed and an individual's sensitivity to time zone changes. Common symptoms may include:
Fatigue
Irritability
Headache
Dehydration
Nausea
Reduced appetite
Constipation andirritable bowel syndrome
Daytime sleepiness
Apathy (lack of interest)
Impaired judgment and decision-making
Memory lapses
Difficulty in falling asleep at nightDid you know?

Flying west may seem easier than flying east. This is because when you fly westwards, you move to later time zones, which is generally easier for the body to adapt to. On the contrary, while flying east, you move ahead in time zones and have to adjust to an earlier schedule, which can be more difficult.
CAUSES OF JET LAG
Causes Of Jet Lag

Jet lag happens because the body's internal clock (also known as circadian rhythm) is out of sync with the time zone to which you have traveled.
RISK FACTORS OF JET LAG
Risk Factors Of Jet lag

Jet lag can affect anyone traveling rapidly across multiple time zones, but certain factors can increase the risk of experiencing more severe symptoms. These risk factors include:
1. TRAVEL-RELATED FACTORS
1. Travel-related factors
Number of time zones crossed:This is the primary risk factor. The more time zones crossed, the greater the disruption to the body's circadian rhythm and the more severe the jet lag.
Travel duration:The longer the travel duration, the greater the risk of jet lag, as prolonged flights across several time zones.
The direction of travel:Traveling eastward, where you lose hours and move ahead in time, tends to result in more pronounced jet lag than westward travel.
Frequency of travel:Individuals who travel frequently and for longer periods of time are at a higher risk.
Altered light exposure:Traveling to a new time zone often results in changes in the timing and intensity of exposure to natural light, which can confuse the body's internal clock.


Note:Changes in cabin pressure and high altitudes during air travel can also aggravate the symptoms of jet lag.


2. INDIVIDUAL FACTORS
2. Individual factors
Age:Young children and older adults may be more vulnerable to jet lag.
Individual sensitivity:Some individuals are more sensitive to time zone changes due to genetic factors and individual variability in circadian rhythm regulation.
Health status:Underlying health conditions like sleep disorders likeinsomnia,sleep apnea, etc, can affect the body's ability to adapt to new time zones.

Listen to our experts talk about ways to manage insomnia, that can help you mitigate jet lag to some extent.

Caffeine and alcohol Intake:Excessive consumption of these just before the flight can disrupt sleep patterns and contribute to jet lag symptoms.
Dehydration:Air travel can lead to dehydration due to the low humidity. This can lead to fatigue and discomfort associated with jet lag.
Meal timings:Irregular meal timings during travel, especially across different time zones can contribute to jet lag.
Irregular work schedule:People who work irregular or rotating shifts may already have disrupted circadian rhythms, making them more susceptible to jet lag.
Stress and fatigue:Long flights can be physically and mentally exhausting which can contribute to the onset and severity of jet lag.
Lack of preparation:Inadequate preparation for travel, including failing to adjust sleep schedules gradually before departure, can increase the risk of experiencing severe jet lag.What are jet lag calculators?
Jet lag calculators are online tools that help people plan and adapt to different time zones when traveling internationally. They require inputting travel details and providing suggestions for adjusting sleep patterns.
DIAGNOSIS OF JET LAG
Diagnosis Of Jet lag

Jet lag is a condition that people can usually diagnose themselves based on the symptoms they experience after traveling across multiple time zones. However, in severe cases, you might have to visit a doctor who might confirm the diagnosis with:
1. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND MEDICAL HISTORY
1. Physical examination and medical history
The doctor will perform a physical examination and inquire about your medical history, such as your symptoms, sleep habits, and any existing medical conditions that could potentially play a role.
2. SLEEP STUDY
2. Sleep study
It is needed to identify and diagnose severe jet lag symptoms and other sleep issues.

CELEBS AFFECTED
Celebs affectedJennifer Anniston
Hollywood celebrity Jennifer Aniston once shared her personal experience of managing jet lag. "When you land after a long, long flight, go hit the gym and do a 30-minute run. It has worked for me - when I've actually had the energy to go and do it!”Liam Hemsworth

Liam Hemsworth is an Australian actor. He played the role of Josh Taylor in the soap opera Neighbors. “Plan your sleep for the flight. Too little or too much will crush you. When you land, depending on what time of day or night it is, exercise helps you acclimate,” he advised in an interview.
PREVENTION OF JET LAG
Prevention Of Jet lag


Preventing or minimizing jet lag involves strategies that help the body adjust to the new time zone and reduce the severity of its effects. While it may not be possible to completely eliminate jet lag, these tips can help alleviate its symptoms and make the transition to a new time zone smoother:
1. BEFORE TRAVEL
1. Before travel
You can start adjusting your sleep schedule ahead of time to align with the time zone at your destination. Here are a few tips to help you adapt to the time change more easily:
When traveling west, it is advised to delay bedtime by an hour or two, and when traveling east, it is recommended to go to bed an hour or two earlier.
Plan travel arrangements so that you arrive at your destination a minimum of 2 days before any significant commitments, allowing your body sufficient time to get adjusted.
Stomach discomfort and other digestive issues can occur as a result of jet lag. Therefore, having smaller & lighter meals before traveling might alleviate these symptoms.
Opt for daylight arrival flights to boost alertness upon landing and enhance adaptation to the new time zone.
2. DURING TRAVEL
2. During Travel
On the flight, there are several strategies you can use to minimize the effects of jet lag and arrive at your destination feeling more refreshed. Here are some tips:
Planes have low humidity levels, which can cause dehydration. Make sure to drink sufficient water throughout the flight.
Avoid alcohol and caffeine during flight as it can contribute to dehydration and disrupt your sleep patterns.
Wear clothes that are not tight.
Use noise-canceling headphones, white noise, eye masks, earplugs, and comfortable travel pillows and blankets for better sleep during travel.
When it is possible, move around in the cabin.
If it's daytime at your destination, try to stay awake and expose yourself to natural light. If it's nighttime, consider sleeping to align with the local time.
If you're crossing multiple time zones, consider the direction of travel when choosing your seat. If you're traveling eastward, a seat on the east side of the plane may expose you to morning light, helping you adjust.
3. AFTER TRAVEL
3. After Travel
Adjusting to a new time zone after a flight is crucial for preventing or minimizing jet lag. Here are some tips for post-flight to help you adapt more quickly:
Spend time outdoors in natural daylight at your destination as it helps reset your internal clock.
Take a shower to feel refreshed. It will also assist in overcoming jet lag by improving circulation and energy levels while adjusting to a different time zone.
While it can be tempting to take a nap upon arrival, try to resist if it's not part of your regular sleep schedule. Napping can delay the adjustment process.
To avoid oversleeping, set alarms in the morning and make sure to switch on the lights once you wake up.
Engage in light physical activity to help combat fatigue and improve your overall well-being. This can include walking, stretching, or low-intensity exercises.
Try to eat lighter meals in the evening to prevent digestive discomfort and to promote better sleep.
Create a calming bedtime routine to signal to your body that it's time to sleep. This may include activities such as reading, taking a warm bath, or practicing relaxation techniques.
Discuss with your doctor about use of melatonin supplements to reset your sleep-wake cycle.
