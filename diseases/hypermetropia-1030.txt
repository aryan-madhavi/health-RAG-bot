HYPERMETROPIA
HypermetropiaAlso known as Hyperopia, Long-sightedness, or Far-sightedness.
OVERVIEW
Overview

Hyperopia, commonly known as farsightedness, occurs when distant objects appear clearer than nearby objects.

Symptoms include difficulty focusing on close objects, eyestrain, headaches, and blurred vision, especially during tasks requiring close attention. While genetics play a significant role, other factors, like environmental influences, like excessive screen time and near work, also play a role in myopia development.

Regular eye exams are crucial for diagnosing, monitoring changes, and adjusting treatment.

Hyperopia can be managed through prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses. Refractive surgeries like LASIK or PRK offer long-term correction options.

SYMPTOMS OF HYPERMETROPIA
Symptoms Of Hypermetropia

Hypermetropia, hyperopia, or farsightedness is a refractive error where distant objects can be seen more clearly than nearby objects.

Here are some common symptoms associated with hypermetropia:

Eye strain, characterized by tired or sore eyesHeadaches, especially during readingBlurry vision, particularly when focusing on nearby objectsDifficulty readingDouble vision while readingDull eye painSquinting when reading
CAUSES OF HYPERMETROPIA
Causes Of Hypermetropia

Clear vision relies on light passing through the cornea (front of the eye) and eye lens to reach the retina (back of the eye) at the back of the eye. Hyperopia, or farsightedness, occurs due to:

1. Eye shape:Hyperopia often results from a shorter-than-normal eyeball or a flatter cornea.

2. Refraction issues:The eye's shape can hinder light bending correctly, causing it to focus behind the retina. This results in distant objects appearing clear while nearby ones seem blurry.

Hyperopia, in essence, creates a significant disparity between where light focuses and the retina's location. This can lead to considerable difficulty in seeing nearby objects, impacting daily activities and quality of life.
RISK FACTORS FOR HYPERMETROPIA
Risk Factors For Hypermetropia

Several factors can increase the likelihood of developing hypermetropia:

1. Genetics:Family history plays a significant role. If parents or close relatives have hypermetropia, there's a higher chance of inheriting the condition.

Also, a family history of myopia (nearsightedness), amblyopia (lazy eye), strabismus (when the eyes are not aligned properly), congenital cataracts, and metabolic or genetic disease can increase the risk of developing moderate to high hyperopia.

2. Age:Hypermetropia is known to worsen with age, particularly after 40, due to changes in the eye's lens elasticity. This is a natural part of the aging process.

3. Eye structure:The shape of the eye can contribute to hyperopia. Eyes that are shorter than average or have a flatter cornea may be more prone to hyperopia.

4. Environmental factors:Prolonged near work, such as reading or using electronic devices for extended periods, can significantly contribute to the development of hyperopia.

5. Medical conditions:Certain health conditions can increase the risk of hyperopia. For example, diabetes and other conditions that affect blood sugar levels can impact vision. Eye conditions like retinopathy or cataracts may also lead to hyperopia.Did you know?
Maternal smoking during pregnancy heightens the risk, particularly for severe hyperopia.

DIAGNOSIS OF HYPERMETROPIA
Diagnosis Of Hypermetropia

Hyperopia, commonly known as farsightedness, is diagnosed through a comprehensive eye examination conducted by an optometrist or ophthalmologist. The examination encompasses various tests to evaluate different aspects of vision and eye health.

1. Visual acuity:An eye chart measures one's ability to see at various distances. Hyperopia may manifest as difficulty seeing objects up close, while distant vision remains clearer.

2. Diffuse light examination:Examines how light interacts with the eye, revealing physical characteristics associated with hyperopia.

3. Fundoscopy:Examines the back of the eye to detect changes related to hyperopia. Abnormalities like blurred disc margins and crowded vessels can indicate hyperopia or related conditions.

4. Examination of strabismus:Tests like the Alternate Cover-Uncover test detect subtle eye misalignments, revealing latent (hidden) or manifest (visible) strabismus, which can result from untreated hyperopia.

5. Retinoscopy:This procedure involves shining a light into the eyes and observing how it reflects off the retina to estimate refractive error, including hyperopia.

6. Refraction:This procedure uses a phoropter or trial frame and lenses to precisely determine the refractive error of the eyes by having you look through different lenses and provide feedback.

7. Eye health examination:In addition to vision evaluation, examines the health of the eyes using a slit lamp to assess structures like the cornea, lens, and retina, as eye health issues can accompany refractive errors like hyperopia.
PREVENTION OF HYPERMETROPIA
Prevention Of Hypermetropia

While there's no known method to prevent Hyperopia, adopting certain lifestyle practices can support overall eye health and potentially slow its progression:


Spend Time Outdoors:Encourage outdoor activities to increase exposure to natural light, which may help reduce the risk of Hyperopia.
Limit Screen Time:Minimize prolonged close-up activities and take frequent breaks to prevent eye strain.
Follow the 20-20-20 Rule:Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds to relieve eye strain.
Ensure Proper Lighting:Use adequate lighting when reading or doing close-up tasks to reduce eye strain and promote comfort.
Quit Smoking:Smoking increases the risk of several eye conditions, including cataracts and age-related macular degeneration.

3. REFRACTIVE SURGERY
3. Refractive surgery
Various surgical procedures can reshape the cornea or lens to correct hyperopia, including:

LASIK (Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis):This procedure reshapes the cornea with a laser, allowing light to focus properly on the retina.


PRK (Photorefractive Keratectomy):Similar to LASIK but involves removing the outer layer of the cornea before reshaping it with a laser. It's suitable for mild to moderate hyperopia.

LASEK (Laser Epithelial Keratomileusis):A procedure similar to PRK, but a flap is created using a special tool instead of removing the outer corneal layer.


4. CONDUCTIVE KERATOPLASTY (CK)
4. Conductive Keratoplasty (CK)
CK is a non-laser treatment for mild to moderate farsightedness in older adults. It uses radio frequency energy to reshape the cornea temporarily, suitable for mild to moderate hyperopia in older adults.

5. PHAKIC INTRAOCULAR LENSES (PIOLS)
5. Phakic Intraocular Lenses (pIOLs)
pIOL involves implanting an artificial lens in front of or behind the iris, leaving the natural lens intact. It's suitable for severe hyperopia and offers quick recovery and significant vision improvement.

6. REFRACTIVE LENS EXCHANGE (CLEAR LENS EXTRACTION)
6. Refractive lens exchange (Clear lens extraction)
RLE removes the natural lens and replaces it with an artificial one. It's used for significant hyperopia or combined with cataracts.

7. SMALL INCISION LENTICULE EXTRACTION (SMILE)
7. Small Incision Lenticule Extraction (SMILE)
A minimally invasive procedure involving creating a small lenticule within the cornea and removing it through a small incision, is effective for correcting hyperopia.

Note:Surgery may not be advisable for certain medical conditions like glaucoma or cataracts.

Consulting an eye surgeon will help determine the best course of action.

COMPLICATIONS OF HYPERMETROPIA
Complications Of Hypermetropia

Hyperopia, commonly known as farsightedness, can lead to several complications if left uncorrected or untreated:

1. Amblyopia:Hyperopia, particularly in children, can increase the risk of amblyopia (lazy eye) if not corrected early. Amblyopia occurs when the brain favors one eye over the other, leading to decreased vision in the weaker eye.

2. Strabismus (crossed eyes or squint):In some cases, untreated hyperopia can contribute to strabismus, a condition where the eyes are misaligned, causing one eye to turn inward, outward, upward, or downward.

3. Angle-closure disease:Hyperopia increases the risk of angle-closure disease, affecting the eye's drainage angle.

4. Anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (AION):Hyperopia is a risk factor for developing AION, a condition causing sudden vision loss due to decreased blood flow to the optic nerve.

5. Retinal vein occlusion:While the association is debated, hyperopia may increase the likelihood of branch retinal vein occlusion, affecting blood flow in the retina.

6. Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD):Hyperopia may be linked to ARMD, a progressive eye condition affecting central vision in older adults.

7.Eyestrainand fatigue:Constantly straining to focus on nearby objects can lead to eye strain and fatigue, causing discomfort and headaches.

8. Increased risk of eye diseases:Long-term untreated hyperopia may increase the risk of certain eye conditions such as glaucoma, cataracts, and retinal detachment.Did our information help you?In our relentless endeavour to keep improving our services, you are our eyes.
