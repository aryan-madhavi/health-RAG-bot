BREAST CANCER
Breast cancerAlso known as Breast tumor or Breast carcinoma
OVERVIEW
Overview
Breast cancer is a type of cancer that forms in the cells of the breast, most commonly in the ducts or lobules. The cancer cells can travel to different parts of the body through the lymph nodes. It can be caused by genetic factors, hormonal influences, lifestyle habits, and environmental exposures.


Breast cancer usually affects women. However, it can also occur in men and children, though the incidence is rare. In India, breast cancer has become the most common cancer among women. Common symptoms of breast cancer include a lump in the breast, changes in breast shape or size, nipple discharge, or skin dimpling.


Breast cancer treatment depends on the stage and extent of cancer. It may involve surgery to remove the tumor, which can range from removing just the lump to the entire breast. It is often combined with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or hormone therapy, depending on the type and stage of cancer.

CAUSE OF BREAST CANCER
Cause Of Breast Cancer

Normally, the body creates new cells as needed while old or damaged ones naturally die off. In breast cancer, this balance is disrupted, usually triggered by mutations or changes in the DNA of breast cells leading to abnormal and uncontrollable growth of cells.

These cells, often found in the milk ducts or lobules, multiply rapidly and don’t die as they should. Over time, they can form a lump (tumor), and in some cases, may spread to surrounding tissues or other parts of the body.

There are several factors that can trigger the development of breast cancer, which are discussed in the next section.

The factors that increase the risk of breast cancer include:

1. GENDER
1. Gender
Women are much more likely to develop breast cancer than men.
2. AGE
2. Age
The risk for breast cancer increases with age. Most breast cancers are diagnosed after the age of 50.
3. A PERSONAL HISTORY OF BREAST CONDITIONS
3. A personal history of breast conditions
Having certain breast conditions like abnormal cell growth line LCIS (Lobular Carcinoma In Situ) or a past history of breast cancer in one breast can raise the risk of getting cancer in the other breast.
4. BIOLOGICAL FACTORS
4. Biological factors
Having dense breasts
A personal history of radiation therapy
A family history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer
Presence of certain harmful mutations of genes [BReast CAncer genes 1 and 2 (BRCA1 and BRCA2)]

DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER
Diagnosis Of Breast Cancer

The best way to know about breast cancer is through early screening. The different types of breast cancer screening tests include:


1. BREAST SELF-EXAM
1. Breast self-exam
Breast self-examination is a simple, at-home method to check for unusual breast changes. Women should start doing it from age 20, once a month. It takes just 5–10 minutes. The best time to examine is between day 5 and day 10 of the menstrual cycle. Steps include:
Step 1:Stand topless in front of a mirror with your arms relaxed. Carefully observe your breasts for any changes in shape, size, or nipple position.

Step 2:Place your hands on your hips, and bend forward and backward to check for pain or tenderness.

Step 3:Raise one hand behind your head, and with the other, examine your breast from the armpit to the nipple. Repeat the process on the other breast.

Step 4:Use the pads of three middle fingers (pink areas) to examine every inch of your breast tissue in an up-and-down or circular motion, starting from the outer part and moving towards the nipple.

Step 5:Lie down with a cushion under your back and repeat the examination on both breasts, ensuring thorough checks.

Step 6:Gently pinch your nipples with your thumb and forefinger to check for any abnormal discharge.

Learn how to check your breasts at home for early signs of cancer with expert guidance from Dr. Akta Bajaj.

2. CLINICAL BREAST EXAMINATION (CBE)
2. Clinical breast examination (CBE)
A clinical breast exam is performed by a doctor or nurse, who uses their hands to check for lumps, firmness, nipple discharge, or any unusual changes in the breast.
3. BLOOD MARKER TESTS
3. Blood marker tests
Also known as blood tests for tumor markers, these tests help to detect cancer activity in the body. Some of the common blood markers that your doctor might include are:

CA 15.3
CA 27.29 (Breast Cancer Marker)
Carcino Embryonic Antigen (CEA)

4.MAMMOGRAPHY
4.Mammography
It is an X-ray of the breast used to detect early signs of cancer. It is recommended annually for women over 40 or as advised by a doctor. For women with dense breasts, it’s often combined with ultrasound for more accurate results.

5.MR (MAGNETIC RESONANCE) MAMMOGRAM
5.MR (Magnetic resonance) Mammogram
Breast MRI uses magnetic and radio waves to create detailed images and is more effective than mammograms or clinical exams for screening women at high risk, such as those with BRCA mutations. It’s typically used alongside other tests in high-risk groups.

6. OTHER TESTS

6. Other tests
If any abnormality is detected in the screening tests, the woman might be directed to take further tests to help diagnose the condition. These include:

Excision biopsy:A mass of tissue is removed for examination. This is used to determine the types of cells involved in breast cancer.
FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology):A fine gauge needle removes fluid from the breast tissue for microscopic evaluation.
CT scan:It helps to check whether breast cancer has spread to other regions.

TREATMENT OF BREAST CANCER
Treatment Of Breast Cancer


Breast cancer varies in type and growth rate, so treatment must be tailored to each patient’s unique profile. Some common treatment options include:


1. CHEMOTHERAPY
1. Chemotherapy
It involves the use of medications/drugs to shrink or kill the cancerous cells. Chemotherapy before surgery aims to shrink the tumor down & lower the chances of recurrence of the cancer.
Some of the common examples of chemotherapy drugs include:

Cyclophosphamide
Vinblastine
Vinorelbine
Fluorouracil
Capecitabine
Gemcitabine

2. RADIATION THERAPY
2. Radiation therapy
This therapy uses radiation (high-energy rays similar to X-rays) to kill the cancer cells. Types of radiation therapy include:

External-beam radiation therapy (radiation given from a machine outside the body)
Intraoperative radiation therapy (radiation given using a probe in the operating room)
Internal beam or Brachytherapy (radiation given by placing radioactive sources into the tumor)

3. SURGERY
3. Surgery
Mastectomy:It is the surgical removal of the entire breast and is recommended for large tumors, multiple cancer areas, or prior breast radiation.
Breast-conserving therapy (Lumpectomy):This surgery removes only the tumor and a margin of surrounding tissue, preserving most of the breast. It is typically followed by radiation to reduce the recurrence rate.
Breast reconstruction surgery:This surgery recreates the breast shape after mastectomy or lumpectomy using implants or tissue from another body part.

4. HORMONAL THERAPY
4. Hormonal therapy
This treatment approach works by either lowering or blocking the production of the hormones needed for the growth of the cancer cells. Types of drugs used are:

Tamoxifen
Fulvestrant
Letrozole
Megestrol
5. TARGETED THERAPY

5. Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy uses special drugs that focus on specific genes or proteins that help cancer grow. Some common drugs include:

Trastuzumab
Pertuzumab
Neratinib
Alpelisib
6. IMMUNOTHERAPY

6. Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy boosts the body’s immune system to fight cancer by using natural or lab-made substances. It helps slow cancer growth, prevents its spread, and supports the body in destroying cancer cells. Drugs used are:
Pembrolizumab
Atezolizumab
Pertuzumab
