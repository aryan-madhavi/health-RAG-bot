LIVER CANCER
Liver cancerAlso known as Hepatic cancer or Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
OVERVIEW
Overview



The liver is the largest organ of the human body. It helps process food and removes toxins from the body. Liver cancer also referred to as hepatic cancer, starts in the liver cells and is the 6th most prevalent cancer worldwide.

The disease emerges when the natural cell growth process is disrupted, causing uncontrolled tumor formation in the liver. These cancerous cells have the potential to spread to other body parts. Liver cancer symptoms do not show any symptoms in the early stages. Common symptoms include unexplained weight loss, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, and fatigue.

Typically found in older individuals, liver cancer is more common in men and is linked to various risk factors like chronic smoking,obesity, pre-existing liver conditions, excessive alcohol consumption, and specific genetic predispositions.

Treatment options for liver cancer vary based on its stage and extent. They include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or a combination thereof.

TYPES OF LIVER CANCER
Types of Liver Cancer

Liver cancer can be categorized into primary and secondary types.
1. PRIMARY LIVER CANCER
1. Primary liver cancer
Primary liver cancer is the most common type of liver cancer. It originates in the cells called hepatocytes, which are responsible for carrying out various functions of the liver.

Different subtypes of primary liver cancer based on their cellular characteristics are:


Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC):This subtype accounts for the majority of all primary liver cancers. HCC often develops in individuals with underlying chronic liver diseases.

Fibrolamellar Carcinoma:This rare subtype typically affects younger individuals who do not have any underlying chronic liver disease. It has distinct features under a microscope and may have a better prognosis compared to other forms of primary liver cancer.

Cholangiocarcinoma:Unlike HCC which starts in hepatocytes, cholangiocarcinoma arises from bile duct cells within or outside the liver. It occurs less frequently than HCC but can be more challenging to treat due to its location and tendency to spread early on.

2. SECONDARY LIVER CANCER
2. Secondary liver cancer
This occurs when cancer spreads from another part of the body (such as breast, lung, colon) to the liver via blood circulation or direct invasion into adjacent organs like pancreas or stomach.

Give your liver the attention and care it deserves to safeguard it from diseases.

CAUSES OF LIVER CANCER
Causes Of Liver Cancer

The development of liver cancer is a complex process involving the liver cells. Here's an overview of what happens during liver cancer:

DNA, the genetic material, governs cell behavior, growth, division, and cell death.
Multiple mutations in DNA that activate cell division or deactivate tumor suppressor genes, can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and abnormal mass formation in the liver.
Over time, these abnormal cells may spread within the liver or to other organs through the bloodstream or lymphatic system.
RISK FACTORS FOR LIVER CANCER
Risk Factors For Liver Cancer

Here are some common risk factors associated with liver cancer.
It's important to note that having one or more risk factors does not mean the development of liver cancer, but they may increase the likelihood.

DIAGNOSIS OF LIVER CANCER
Diagnosis Of Liver Cancer

To arrive at the diagnosis and chart the treatment course of cancer, it is important to understand its staging. The most common way of staging liver cancer is the TNM staging system, where:

T:Tumor and how many layers of the liver wall the tumor has penetrated
N:Lymph Nodes and how many lymph nodes have cancer spread to. It also looks at where the lymph nodes are affected and how close to the original tumor.
M:Metastasis ie. spread to other parts of the body

Depending on this the cancer is divided into 4 stages. These are:
1. Stage 0:Also known as carcinoma in situ. This stage is distinguished by abnormal cells in the liver lining. The cells can become cancerous (malignant) in the future.

2. Stage I:Cancer is localized to the liver and has not spread to nearby blood vessels or lymph nodes.

3. Stage II:Cancer has either grown larger and/or has invaded nearby blood vessels but has not spread to distant sites or lymph nodes.

4. Stage III:Cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes or structures beyond the liver, but it has not spread to distant organs.

5. Stage IV:Cancer has spread to distant organs or structures, indicating advanced metastatic disease.

The diagnosis consists of the following:
1. MEDICAL HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
1. Medical history and physical examination
Your doctor will begin by taking a detailed medical history, including any risk factors for liver cancer, your medications, lifestyle habits, previous surgeries, or any other health conditions. A physical examination may reveal signs such as an enlarged liver and jaundice.
2. BLOOD TESTS

2. Blood tests
These tests are part of a comprehensive diagnostic approach, often combined with other imaging and biopsy procedures. The doctor can assess the overall health withliver and kidney functiontests and detect any abnormalities withblood cell counts. High levels ofalpha-fetoprotein (AFP)and other tumor markers may also indicate liver cancer.

3. IMAGING STUDIES

3. Imaging studies
Imaging tests are crucial for evaluating the liver and identifying any tumors. Common imaging studies include:
Ultrasound:A non-invasive test using sound waves to create an image of the liver.


CT (Computed Tomography) scan:X-ray images taken from different angles to create detailed cross-sectional images of the liver.


MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):This imaging technique uses a powerful magnetic field, radio frequency pulses, and a computer to produce detailed pictures of the liver and surroundings.


PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scan:Helps determine the extent of the disease and if it has spread to other parts of the body.


Angiography:It is a method to visualize blood vessels, but isn't very effective in spotting small HCC tumors. It's mostly used for mapping the liver's structure before surgery.
4. LIVER BIOPSY

4. Liver biopsy
If a suspicious mass or tumor is detected, a liver biopsy may be performed to obtain a small tissue sample for analysis under a microscope. This helps confirm the presence of cancer cells and determine the type and stage of the cancer.

5. LAPAROSCOPY
5. Laparoscopy
Also known as keyhole surgery, is a minimally invasive procedure where a small tube with a camera and light (laparoscope) is inserted through a small abdominal cut. This helps assess the liver and surrounding areas, aiding in determining if surgery to remove cancer is feasible.

TREATMENT OF LIVER CANCER
Treatment Of Liver Cancer

The treatment of liver cancer depends on size, location and extent of the cancer. Management of liver cancer include:
1. SURVEILLANCE
1. Surveillance
It involves closely monitoring small lesions (<1 cm) discovered in screenings, typically with follow-ups every 3 months. The process includes regular exams and tests according to a set schedule.

2. ABLATION THERAPY
2. Ablation therapy
Ablation techniques are used to destroy liver tumors without removing them surgically. Common ablation techniques include:

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA):High-energy radio waves are used to heat and kill cancer cells by inserting special needles into the tumor through the skin or abdomen.


Microwave therapy:Microwaves generate high temperatures that can destroy cancer cells or enhance their sensitivity to radiation and specific anticancer drugs.


Percutaneous ethanol injection:Pure alcohol (ethanol) is directly injected into the tumor using a small needle to kill cancer cells. Local or general anesthesia may be used based on the number of liver tumors.


Cryoablation:Cancer cells are frozen and destroyed using a specialized instrument. Ultrasound may guide this process.


Electroporation therapy:Electrical pulses are sent through an electrode placed in a tumor to kill cancer cells. This therapy is under research in clinical trials.

3. RADIATION THERAPY
3. Radiation therapy
External beam radiation:High-energy X-rays are used to destroy cancer cells or shrink tumors from outside the body.
Radioembolization:Tiny radioactive beads are injected into the blood vessels that supply the liver tumor, delivering radiation directly to the cancer cells.

4. CHEMOTHERAPY
4. Chemotherapy
Systemic chemotherapy:Drugs are administered orally or intravenously to kill cancer cells or slow their growth.
Transarterial chemotherapy:Chemotherapy drugs are injected directly into the artery supplying the liver, delivering a higher concentration of the drug to the tumor.

5. IMMUNOTHERAPY
5. Immunotherapy
Immunotherapeutic drugs boost the immune system's ability to recognize and attack cancer cells. This therapy is used in the treatment of advanced liver cancer. The most commonly used drugs are:AtezolizumabNivolumabIpilimumabPembrolizumab

6. EMBOLIZATION THERAPY
6. Embolization therapy
Embolization therapies are designed to cut off the blood supply to the tumor, reducing its growth. This may involve:


Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE):A combination of chemotherapy drugs and tiny beads is injected into the artery supplying the tumor, blocking its blood supply.
Radioembolization (Yttrium-90):Tiny radioactive beads are placed into the arteries supplying the liver tumor, delivering radiation directly to the cancer cells.

7. SURGERY
7. Surgery
Hepatectomy:This involves the surgical removal of the part of the liver that contains the tumor.
Liver transplant:In cases where the tumor is small and the liver is severely damaged, a liver transplant may be considered.

8. TARGETED DRUG THERAPY
8. Targeted drug therapy
Targeted therapies involve using drugs to attack specific cancer cells with minimal harm to normal cells. It is less invasive than chemotherapy or radiation. Commonly used drugs are:
Bevacizumab
Cabozantinib
Ramucirumab

Some targeted therapies for advanced liver cancer include:
SorafenibandLenvatinib:These drugs block signals that promote cancer cell growth and formation of new blood vessels.
Regorafenib:A drug used for advanced liver cancer that hasn't responded to other treatments.

COMPLICATIONS OF LIVER CANCER
Complications Of Liver Cancer

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a type of liver cancer, can cause significant complications that include:


Liver failure:Liver cancer can impair the normal functioning of the liver, leading to liver failure that can be life-threatening.

Hepatic encephalopathy:It is a condition where the liver's inability to remove toxins like ammonia from the blood affects brain function. It can lead to confusion, difficulty concentrating, and changes in mental status.

Portal vein thrombosis:This complication involves the formation of blood clots in the portal vein, a major blood vessel in the liver.

Worsening ascites:Ascites is the accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity. In HCC, ascites can worsen.

Variceal bleeding:Liver cancer can cause increased pressure in the portal vein, a major blood vessel in the liver. This can result in portal hypertension, and an increased risk of bleeding in the digestive tract.

Obstructive jaundice:Liver cancer can obstruct the bile ducts, causing a buildup of bilirubin in the body.

Pyogenic liver abscess:Liver cancer can predispose individuals to infections within the liver, resulting in the formation of pus-filled pockets (abscesses).

Metastasis:Liver cancer can spread (metastasize) to other organs or parts of the body, leading to additional complications associated with secondary tumors in those areas.
