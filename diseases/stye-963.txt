STYE
StyeAlso known as sty a hordeolum
OVERVIEW
Overview
A stye is a painful red bump on the rim of the eyelid that may look similar to a boil or a pimple. They are often caused by a bacterial infection in the hair follicle of an eyelash.

Risk factors for developing a stye include poor eyelid hygiene, rubbing or touching the eyes, wearing contact lenses for an extended period, and certain underlying medical conditions such asdiabetes.

Most styes resolve on their own within a few days to a week. It is important to avoid squeezing or popping them since the infection may reach to other parts of the eyelid or eye.

Warm compresses applied to the affected area might help reduce inflammation and facilitate healing. Antibiotic eye drops or ointments may be recommended in some circumstances to speed up the healing process and prevent complications.

If a stye does not improve after a week, gets very painful, or interferes with vision, it is best to see an eye doctor.

TYPES OF STYE
Types of stye

There are two kinds of styes:
1. External stye
It develops at the base of the eyelash due to an infection in the hair follicle resembling a pimple.  It can be pus-filled and is painful to touch.


2. Internal stye
It grows inside the eyelid due to an infection in a meibomian gland (oil-producing gland)and is considerably more painful than an external stye. It can produce continual pain and irritation in the eye, as well as the sensation that something is stuck in the eye.


Did you know?
People generally confuse stye with chalazion. While a stye is a painful swelling that usually occurs at the edge of the eyelid and is caused by an infected eyelash root, a chalazion is usually not painful and appears further back on the eyelid than a stye. It occurs when the oil gland in the eyelid clogs.
CAUSES OF STYE
Causes Of Stye

Stye is a bacterial infection caused by the bacterium staphylococcus. Our eyelids include numerous oil glands that produce an oily film on the surface of the eye, which aids in the maintenance of healthy eye lubrication. However, these oil glands might become clogged due to old oil, debris, dead skin cells, or germs. When this occurs, debris accumulates, resulting in gland clogging. Stye can also be caused by blepharitis (swelling of eyelid). This condition causes the eyelids at the base of the lashes to become red and puffy.
RISK FACTORS FOR STYE
Risk Factors For Stye

Did you know?
Wearing masks led to a rise in cases of stye during the COVID-19 pandemic.Research has shown that wearing a mask or breathing upward while wearing a mask, improperly-fitted masks, and fogging glasses, can cause the skin around the eyes to become oily and congested, increasing the risk of styes.
DIAGNOSIS OF STYE
Diagnosis Of Stye

An ophthalmologist can diagnose a stye by conducting a physical examination of the affected eye. During the examination, the ophthalmologist will inspect the eyelid to look for any visible signs of a stye, such as redness, swelling, or a small bump on the eyelid.
The ophthalmologist may also ask the patient about their symptoms, such as pain or discomfort in the affected eye, and whether they have had styes in the past.
In some cases, the ophthalmologist may also conduct a culture test to determine the exact type of bacteria causing the stye.

COMPLICATIONS OF STYE
Complications Of Stye

It is extremely rare for any complication to occur with respect to the development of stye. Possible complications are discussed below:
1. CHALAZION (MEIBOMIAN CYST)
1. Chalazion (meibomian cyst)
A stye occurs when the meibomian gland (which secretes sebum to moisturize the eye) becomes inflamed and congested. Stye formation inside the eyelid on a regular basis may result in cyst formation near the aperture of the meibomian gland.
2. PRESEPTAL OR PERIORBITAL CELLULITIS
2. Preseptal or periorbital cellulitis
Since stye is a bacterial infection, if left untreated or just partially treated, it can spread to the surrounding tissues around the eye, including the periorbital tissues.
This type of infection is known as preseptal or periorbital cellulitis, and it causes the skin around the eye to grow red and swollen. Antibiotics are essential to treat this condition.
3. ORBITAL CELLULITIS
3. Orbital cellulitis
If the preseptal cellulitis progresses further inward it can cause orbital cellulitis. Given the severity of the illness and the seriousness of the condition, hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics may be necessary. It may require immediate surgery to drain the pus.
ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR STYE
Alternative Therapies For Stye

Alternative therapies include:
1. BLOODLETTING THERAPY
1. Bloodletting therapy
This technique aids in eliminating “Heat” and Qi/Blood stagnation (a slowing or pooling of the blood due to a disruption of heart qi) that can help recover stye.
2. ACUPUNCTURE
2. Acupuncture
Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves sticking finely pointed needles in areas of the body known as acupuncture points. Applying gentle pressure using your fingertips on the infraorbital foramen and near the base of the thumb, can help tackle the symptoms of a stye and provide relief from the pain and inflammation. Styes usually resolve on their own, but acupuncture can speed recovery and lessen symptoms. It is also believed that the needles stimulate specific nerves and muscles, which in turn release natural pain-relieving hormones in the body.


Note:To help support the acupuncture treatment, maintaining a healthy simple diet is recommended. Hot, stimulating foods such as coffee and hot peppers are not recommended.
LIVING WITH STYE
Living With Stye

A stye can significantly impact a person's quality of life, both physically and emotionally.
Here are some of the ways a stye can impact your quality of life:
1. PHYSICAL IMPACT
1. Physical impact
A stye can cause pain, redness, and swelling, making it uncomfortable to open or close the affected eye. This can interfere with daily activities such as reading, working, and driving.
In some cases, a stye may also cause blurred vision or sensitivity to light, further affecting a person's ability to perform tasks.
2. EMOTIONAL IMPACT
2. Emotional impact
A stye can lead to self-consciousness and embarrassment, particularly if it is visible to others. People with styes may feel uncomfortable interacting with others or may avoid social situations altogether. Additionally, the discomfort and inconvenience of a stye may lead to feelings of frustration and irritability.
While a stye is usually a minor condition that resolves on its own, seeking prompt treatment and practicing good eye hygiene can help to prevent styes and minimize their impact on daily life.Did our information help you?In our relentless endeavour to keep improving our services, you are our eyes.
