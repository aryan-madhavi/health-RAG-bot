TETANUS
TetanusAlso known as Trismus and Lockjaw
OVERVIEW
Overview
Tetanus, commonly known as lockjaw, is a nervous system disorder characterized by muscle spasms, particularly of the jaw and neck. This infection is caused by the bacteria Clostridium tetani, which are found in the soil. Tetanus symptoms usually emerge about 7 to 10 days after the initial infection. However, this can vary from 4 days to about 3 weeks and may take months, in some cases.


Open wounds that are soiled, sharing contaminated needles, and deliveries in unhygienic conditions are the main risk factors for getting tetanus. Most cases occur in people who did not complete their primary tetanus vaccination schedule or did not receive any booster shot within the previous decade.


Tetanus is a deadly and highly debilitating condition that, fortunately, can be prevented by timely vaccinations. The tetanus vaccines should be given to children. The primary vaccination schedule consists of 5 tetanus shots given as part of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccination in children between 2 months to 6 years.


Tetanus is treated with wound care, antibiotics, and tetanus immunoglobulin to neutralize the toxin, along with supportive care for symptoms.

CAUSES OF TETANUS
Causes Of Tetanus


Tetanus is caused by a toxin produced by Clostridium tetani bacteria spores found in dust, animal feces, and soil. When these spores enter a deep flesh wound, they transform into bacteria that release a lethal toxin known as tetanospasmin.

The toxin damages the muscles, specifically the motor neurons that control muscle function. This causes muscle spasms and stiffness, which is a major symptom of tetanus.

Tetanus cases are frequently seen in people who have never been immunized or in adults who have not received their 10-year booster shot. Tetanus is not a contagious disease and thus cannot be passed from person to person.

Other ways:

Tetanus bacteria can also infect someone’s body through breaks in the skin caused by:
Clean superficial wounds (when only the topmost layer of skin is scraped off)Surgical proceduresInsect bitesDental infectionsCompound fractures (an exposed broken bone)Chronic sores and infectionsIntravenous (IV) drug useIntramuscular injections (shots given in a muscle).
Tetanus cases are frequently seen in people who have never been immunized or in adults who have not received their 10-year booster shot. Tata 1mg offers adult vaccinations with convenient home visits, making it easier than ever to prioritize your health.Book Your Slot





SYMPTOMS OF TETANUS
Symptoms Of Tetanus

The most common sign of this infection is tightening of the jaw muscles. Tetanus infection can lead to serious health problems, including being unable to open the mouth and having trouble swallowing and breathing. Other symptoms can include:

Jaw crampingSudden, involuntary muscle spasms often in the stomachPainful muscle stiffness all over the bodyTrouble swallowingSeizures (jerking or staring)HeadacheFeverExcessive sweatingChanges in blood pressure and heart rate

Did you know?
Spasm progressively extends to the facial muscles causing the typical facial expression of fixed sarcastic grimace and anxious expression called “ risus sardonicus”.
TYPES OF TETANUS
Types Of Tetanus

There are four forms of tetanus, based on clinical findings. They include:

1. GENERALIZED TETANUS
1. Generalized tetanus
It is the most prevalent kind. Typically, the head and neck muscles are the first to become tight and spastic, with the rest of the body eventually being affected. The full recovery from these spasms may take several months, and they can persist for up to 4 weeks.


2. LOCALIZED TETANUS
2. Localized tetanus
It is an uncommon form of the disease in which patients have persistent contraction of muscles in the same body part as the injury. These contractions could last for several weeks before fading down gradually.


3. NEONATAL TETANUS
3. Neonatal tetanus
It is a type of tetanus that manifests within a week of birth in newborn babies. In case the mother is not immune, neonatal tetanus affects newborns who are not protected by their immune system or antibodies from the mother.


Note: The newborn should receive human tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) without delay. Also, it can be prevented by immunizing the mother before or during pregnancy or by ensuring a clean delivery in a sterile environment.


4. CEREBRAL TETANUS
4. Cerebral tetanus
It is also called cephalic tetanus, which involves muscles of the face and larynx. It only affects the head's nerves and muscles. The most frequent cause of cephalic tetanus is head trauma. It is extremely uncommon, making up around 1% to 3% of tetanus cases.
Did you know?
A history of diphtheria or tetanus vaccinations is believed to be associated with less severe manifestations of COVID-19.

RISK FACTORS FOR TETANUS
Risk Factors For Tetanus

Tetanus usually occurs in persons who are not immunized, partially immunized, or fully immunized but lack adequate booster doses. Other risk factors can include the following:

1. CONTAMINATED CUTS OR WOUNDS
1. Contaminated cuts or wounds

Tetanus bacteria can enter the body through skin breaks, especially from contaminated objects like nails or needles, or through contact with feces or saliva.

2. UNVACCINATED MOTHER
2. Unvaccinated mother

Tdap vaccination during each pregnancy protects newborns when they’re most vulnerable.

3. DELIVERY IN CONTAMINATED AREAS
3. Delivery in contaminated areas

Obstetric tetanus occurs during pregnancy orwithin 6 weeks of the end of pregnancy. It happens following the contamination of wounds with Clostridium tetani spores during pregnancy or the use of contaminated tools during deliveries or abortions.

4. SEPTIC CUTTING OF THE UMBILICAL CORD
4. Septic cutting of the umbilical cord

Neonatal tetanus occurs when non-sterile instruments are used to cut the umbilical cord or when contaminated material is used to cover the umbilical stump.

5. FAMILY HISTORY
5. Family history

A history of neonatal tetanus in a previous child increases the risk for neonatal tetanus in subsequent children.

6.DIABETES
6.Diabetes

Patients who have diabetes and chronic wounds are more prone to tetanus than other populations.

Note: Overall, diabetics are more likely to contract tetanus than non-diabetics. Do not let diabetes impact your quality of life.

7. HISTORY OF IMMUNOSUPPRESSION
7. History of immunosuppression

Individuals who are on medications for autoimmune conditions or post-organ transplant have low immunity, which can increase their chances of tetanus infections.

8. SHARING CONTAMINATED NEEDLES
8. Sharing contaminated needles

Skin punctures by contaminated needles (such as those used to inject illegal drugs or to tattoo or do body piercing) can also lead to tetanus.

DIAGNOSIS OF TETANUS
Diagnosis Of Tetanus

No confirmatory laboratory testing is available; the diagnosis is made clinically. Other things to help confirm the diagnosis include:

1. HISTORY
1. History

When there is a history of a prior tetanus-prone injury and insufficient tetanus immunization, tetanus should be suspected in particular. Tetanus can be identified by a person's recent history of trauma, wounds, scrapes, and punctures, as well as by a doctor looking for specific symptoms and indicators.


2. SPATULA TEST
2. Spatula test

The spatula test is a simple diagnostic test. Touching the throat with a spatula in normal individuals elicits a gag reflex and efforts to expel the spatula; a negative result. If tetanus is present, a reflex spasm occurs, and the patient bites the spatula; a positive result.

Getting tested has never been easier. Tata 1mg Labs ensures top-tier diagnostic accuracy.

PREVENTION OF TETANUS
Prevention Of Tetanus

Vaccination and good wound care are the cornerstones in the prevention of a tetanus infection. They are discussed as follows:

1. VACCINATION
1. Vaccination

The only way to prevent a tetanus infection is by getting vaccinated on time. The tetanus vaccine is given as part of the following vaccines:

Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine: Contains full doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (whooping cough) vaccines.
Diphtheria and tetanus (DT) vaccine
Tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine: Contains a full dose of the tetanus vaccine and a lower dose of diphtheria and whooping cough vaccines.
Tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine
Tetanus Toxoid (TT) vaccine

Note: DTaP/DT are only given to babies and children younger than 7 years, whereas Tdap/Td/TT are given to adolescents and adults.

Who should take the tetanus vaccination and when?

Children

Children between 2 months to 6 years should get 5 DTaP shots. Three doses at 6, 10 & 14 weeks and two booster doses at 16-24 months and 5-6 years of age, respectively.
Children who had a very bad reaction to DTaP can receive the DT vaccine. However, they will not receive any protection against whooping cough.
Children 11-12 years old should get 1 booster shot of Tdap.



Adults

Adults over 18 years who did not receive primary immunization, three doses of the Td vaccine are indicated. Two doses are administered at least 4 weeks apart, and the third dose is given 6-12 months after the second dose. The Tdap vaccine can substitute for any one of the Td doses.
Adults who have completed their primary vaccination schedule should get TT or Td shot every 10 years till the age of 65. One dose of Tdap vaccine may be administered in place of Tt/Td vaccine.

Pregnant women

The national immunization schedule in India recommends the 2 doses of TT/Td regardless of the immunization status of pregnant women. There should be a minimum gap of 4 weeks between the two doses. Tdap vaccination can also be considered instead of the second dose of the TT/Td injection.
If a mother received 2 TT/Td doses in the last pregnancy and gets pregnant within 3 years, then only one booster dose is recommended.

2. APPROPRIATE WOUND CARE
2. Appropriate wound care
Control bleeding:Use a clean tissue, piece of gauze, or clean cloth to apply direct pressure to the cut or wound until bleeding stops. To aid in reducing bleeding, try to elevate the arm or leg above the heart if possible.

Maintain hygiene:First of all, wash your hands before cleaning and dressing the wound. Once the bleeding has stopped, a saline solution, bottled water, or clear running water should be used to rinse the wound.
Cover the wound:Use a sterile bandage after using an antibiotic cream to lower the chance of infection.

Change the dressing:Replace the bandage at least once every day, or whenever the dressing is soiled or wet. You can use an antibiotic ointment to control the infection.

Manage adverse reactions:If you observe any rash or wound getting worse due to antibiotic use or if you are allergic to the adhesive used in bandages, switch to adhesive-free dressings or sterile gauze and paper tape.

TREATMENT OF TETANUS
Treatment Of Tetanus

Tetanus is a medical emergency, and its management comprises the following:

1. EARLY AND AGGRESSIVE WOUND DEBRIDEMENT
1. Early and aggressive wound debridement

This involves thoroughly cleaning the wound with sterile or clean water and an antiseptic solution to remove dirt, debris, or foreign objects that could harbor bacteria.
In cases where there is dead or contaminated tissue, surgical debridement may be necessary to eliminate environments conducive to bacterial growth.

Always keep your first aid kit handy in case of an emergency.

2. ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY
2. Antimicrobial therapy

Although they are always advised, antibiotics probably only have a little part to play in the treatment of tetanus. It is crucial to note that without proper wound debridement, appropriate antibiotic therapy may fall short of eliminating C. tetani. Drugs used are:
MetronidazolePenicillin GCefuroxime

3.HUMAN TETANUS IMMUNE GLOBULIN (HTIG)
3.Human tetanus immune globulin (HTIG)

Neutralization of unbound toxins with Human tetanus immune globulin is given.
All individuals with suspected tetanus should immediately receive both passive (with TIG) and active (tetanus toxoid–containing vaccines).

4. DRUGS TO CONTROL MUSCLE SPASMS
4. Drugs to control muscle spasms
Benzodiazepines (likediazepam)PancuroniumAntispasmodics (likebaclofen)Magnesium sulfate

5. HOSPITALIZATION AND SUPPORTIVE CARE
5. Hospitalization and supportive care

People with severe tetanus need to stay in an intensive care environment. As sedatives inhibit breathing, they may need to stay under ventilation temporarily.
Nutritional support should also be initiated early. As the energy demands in tetanus can be extremely high due to repeated spasms, excessive sweating, muscular contractions, etc.
Heparinor any other anticoagulant should be administered early to prevent blood clotting in the veins.
Physical therapy is also suggested as soon as spasms have stopped.

6. VACCINATION DURING RECOVERY
6. Vaccination during recovery

Tetanus disease does not provide immunity against tetanus. Active immunization should be initiated or continued with a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine as soon as the person’s condition has stabilized.
Did you know?
​Researchers are developing special lab-made antibodies (monoclonal antibodies) that can block the tetanus toxin from affecting the body. In animal studies, these antibodies have shown promise in both preventing and treating tetanus. However, this treatment is still under research and not yet available for general use.
COMPLICATIONS OF TETANUS
Complications Of Tetanus

Serious health problems that can happen because of tetanus include:

Laryngospasm:It is an uncontrolled/involuntary tightening of the vocal cords that may lead to interference with breathing.

Fractures:Fractures of the spine or long bones may result from involuntary muscle movements.

Hypertensionand/or abnormal heart rhythm: Hyperactivity seen in tetanus may lead to hypertension. It can also cause abnormal heart rhythm.

Nosocomial infections:These are infections that are acquired while getting medical care, but were absent at the time of admission.

Pulmonary embolism:It refers to a blood clot that has passed through the bloodstream from another part of the body and blocked the major artery of the lung or one of its branches.

Aspirationpneumonia:It is a lung infection that develops when things like saliva or vomit accidentally go into the lungs.

Death:Tetanus can be fatal in some cases. These mostly include people 60 years of age or older and those who have never received a vaccination.

Did You Know?
There has been a 96% reduction in tetanus cases since 1988, largely due to scaled-up immunization programmes.

ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR TETANUS
Alternative Therapies For Tetanus

A few alternative therapies that have shown some promise in the management of tetanus include:

BOTULINUM TOXIN
Botulinum toxin

Botulinum toxin, also called “miracle poison,” is a neurotoxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Studies show that, other than immunization, the administration of this toxin is a treatment approach that has been used in recent years to reduce rigidity and spasms in tetanus patients.

LIVING WITH TETANUS
Living With Tetanus

Tetanus can have various adverse effects on a person’s lifestyle, depending on the severity of the symptoms. The challenge or ease of living with tetanus varies for each survivor, subject to the availability of medical care and rehabilitation opportunities, and their family and social support. Various forms of rehabilitation and support include:

GET PHYSICAL THERAPY
