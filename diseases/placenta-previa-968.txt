PLACENTA PREVIA
Placenta previaAlso known as Abnormally Invasive Placenta and Low lying placenta
OVERVIEW
Overview
The placenta is a special organ in a pregnant woman's body that feeds and protects the growing baby. Placenta previa is a condition during pregnancy in which the placenta grows in the lowest part of the womb (uterus) and covers all or part of the opening to the cervix.

The main sign of placenta previa is bright red vaginal bleeding, usually without pain, after the second trimester of pregnancy.

The exact cause of placenta previa is not known, however, the risk factors include history of placenta previa, older maternal age (above 35 years), prior uterine surgeries or abortions, smoking amongst other factors.

The management of placenta previa depends on its severity, gestational age, and the mother's condition. In mild cases or earlier in pregnancy, close monitoring may be sufficient. However, in severe cases or near the due date, a C-section is often recommended to prevent potentially life-threatening bleeding during vaginal delivery.

SYMPTOMS OF PLACENTA PREVIA
Symptoms Of Placenta Previa

The main symptom of placenta previa is sudden light to heavy bleeding from the vagina. The symptoms usually begin after 20 weeks of gestation. Any bleeding can be representative of problems with the placenta. Some of the specific symptoms include:
Bright red-colored bleeding from the vagina during the second trimester of pregnancy
Bleeding after intercourse
Mild cramping or contractions in the abdomen, belly, or back
Uterine contractions accompany bleeding.
Note: Not everyone who has placenta previa has vaginal bleeding. About one-third of people with placenta previa don’t have this symptom.

TYPES OF PLACENTA PREVIA
Types Of Placenta Previa

The type of placenta previa depends on its location, which is determined by ultrasound imaging of the placenta's position. Common types of placenta previa include:
1. MARGINAL PLACENTA PREVIA
1. Marginal placenta previa
This is also called a low-lying placenta. When the placenta is positioned at the end of the cervix. The placenta is touching the cervix but not covering it.
This type of placenta previa is more likely to resolve on its own before your baby’s due date.
2. PARTIAL PLACENTA PREVIA
2. Partial placenta previa
When the placenta partially covers the cervix.
3. COMPLETE OR TOTAL PLACENTA PREVIA
3. Complete or total placenta previa
In this type the placenta is completely covering the cervix, blocking the vagina. This type of placenta previa is less likely to correct on its own.

CAUSES OF PLACENTA PREVIA
Causes Of Placenta Previa

There is no known cause of placenta previa. It may just be a random abnormality, as the placement of the placenta in the uterus varies from person to person and from pregnancy to pregnancy.


In recent studies, it has been shown that about1% to 15%of women may have placenta previa at some point in their pregnancy. However, only1 in 200 womenare affected by it in the third trimester.


However, there are certain risk factors that can increase one’s chances of developing placenta previa.
RISK FACTORS FOR PLACENTA PREVIA
Risk Factors For Placenta Previa

Understanding the risk factors associated with placenta previa is essential for identifying individuals who may be at higher risk of this pregnancy complication. These include:
1. ADVANCED AGE
1. Advanced age
Women above the age of 35 years are at increased risk of developing this complication. It can be due to changes in the uterine environment.
Know more about how a woman’s body changes post her 30’s.

2. PREVIOUS HISTORY OF PLACENTA PREVIA
2. Previous history of placenta previa
These women are at a higher risk of experiencing it again in their current pregnancy and should be closely monitored during prenatal care.
3. SMOKING
3. Smoking
Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of placenta previa by 2.6 times when compared to nonsmokers.

4. MULTIPLE PREGNANCIES
4. Multiple pregnancies
Being pregnant multiple times or with more than one baby (eg. twins or triplets) can increase the risk of placenta previa.
5. PRIOR ABORTIONS
5. Prior abortions
This may increase the risk of placenta previa by potentially causing uterine scarring or changes in the uterine environment that affect placental implantation during a subsequent pregnancy.
6.UTERINE FIBROIDS
6.Uterine fibroids
These are noncancerous growths on the uterus during childbearing years and can lead to placenta previa.
7. UTERINE SURGERY
7. Uterine surgery
A previous C-section or a D&C (dilation and curettage) is a procedure to remove tissue from inside the uterus that can increase the chances of developing placenta previa.
8. ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGY (ART)
8. Assisted reproductive technology (ART)
It is a medical procedure that helps individuals or couples conceive including techniques like in vitro fertilization (IVF). It may increase the risk of placenta previa due to the potential for abnormal placental implantation in the uterus after these fertility treatments.
9. PREVIOUS SCARS
9. Previous scars
These, if present in the uterus, create an area with lots of oxygen and collagen and can stick to these scars, which might cause the placenta to cover the cervix or grow into the uterine walls.
10. PREECLAMPSIA
10. Preeclampsia
It involves high blood pressure and organ damage that can sometimes affect the placenta.
11. USE OF CERTAIN RECREATIONAL DRUGS
11. Use of certain recreational drugs
Use of drugs such as cocaine during pregnancy increases the risk of placenta previa due to its adverse effects on placental development and function.


Did you know?
Certain studies have suggested that more baby boys are born among mothers with placenta previa. However, more detailed research is required in this aspect.
DIAGNOSIS OF PLACENTA PREVIA
Diagnosis Of Placenta Previa

Placenta previa is usually diagnosed in a routine ultrasound around 20 weeks of pregnancy. It is either diagnosed during a routine prenatal appointment or after an episode of vaginal bleeding.
The diagnosis is usually done by:
1. MEDICAL HISTORY
1. Medical history
A thorough medical history is crucial for detecting placenta previa because it helps identify risk factors.
2. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
2. Physical examination
It includes speculum examination (a hinged instrument, is used to inspect the cervix and vaginal walls) to assess vaginal bleeding. Also, digital examination should be avoided to prevent massive hemorrhage due to the risk of dislodging the placenta.
3. IMAGING TECHNIQUES
3. Imaging techniques
Ultrasound:It is the primary diagnostic tool for placenta previa because it provides non-invasive, detailed images of the placenta's position and the cervix's location.
Transvaginal ultrasound:During this procedure, a wandlike device is placed inside the vagina to study the tissues and organs beyond it. This is crucial for diagnosing placenta previa, as it provides detailed images of the placenta's location relative to the cervix and uterine walls.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan:It can also be used to diagnose placenta previa, especially in cases where ultrasound results are inconclusive or further clarification is needed.

TREATMENT OF PLACENTA PREVIA
Treatment Of Placenta Previa

There's no specific treatment for placenta previa. However, the goal of management is to limit the bleeding so you can get as close as possible to your due date.
If the placenta is near or covering just a part of the cervix and there are no evident symptoms or bleeding the doctor may recommend:
Reducing your activities like running, exercising, and lifting
Bed rest at home
Pelvic rest involving no intercourse, no tampons, and no douching
More hospital visits to monitor the condition
For moderate to severe cases of placenta previa or frequent vaginal bleeding, other treatments could include:
Bed rest at the hospital
Medications to prevent early labor like:
Indomethacin
Nifedipine
Intravenous (IV)magnesium sulfatecan be given to the pregnant woman for delaying labor
Steroid shots ofbetamethasonecan be given which help the baby's lungs develop faster
Shot of special medicine called Rhogam if the mother’s blood type is Rh-negative to avoid further complications leading to Erythroblastosis fetalis (hemolytic anemia in the fetus caused by incompatibility between maternal and fetal blood groups)
Blood transfusions in case of heavy bleeding.

Note:In a few cases, an emergency C-section may be recommended if the bleeding is heavy and cannot be controlled.

COMPLICATIONS OF PLACENTA PREVIA
Complications Of Placenta Previa

Placenta previa can present with pregnancy complications for both the parent and baby. Let us look at some of the things that it can lead to:
EFFECT ON THE FETUS
Effect on the fetus
Premature birth:It is when a baby is born too early before 37 weeks of pregnancy has been completed. Placenta previa leads to premature birth in approximately 5% of cases.
Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR):This is a condition in which a baby in the womb does not grow as expected which is due to poor placental blood supply.
Increased risk of death:Placenta previa can increase the risk of neonatal deaths, which refers to the unfortunate loss of babies within the first 28 days of life.
EFFECT ON THE MOTHER
Effect on the mother
Severe bleeding:In a few cases of placenta previa, severe bleeding may occur prior to, during, or after labor and delivery requiring blood transfusions.
Placenta accreta:It is a serious but rare condition that occurs when the placenta grows deeply into the uterine wall and causes heavy bleeding. A woman with placenta previa is at an increased risk of placenta accreta after childbirth.
Cesarean delivery:In many cases of placenta previa a cesarean delivery is required unless the placenta moves far enough away from the cervical opening before delivery.
