INTRAHEPATIC CHOLESTASIS OF PREGNANCY (ICP)
Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP)Also known as Obstetric cholestasis or Cholestasis of pregnancy.
OVERVIEW
Overview

Cholestasis of pregnancy (CP), also known as intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), is a liver disorder that occurs during pregnancy. Normally, the liver processes bile to aid in fat digestion, but in cholestasis, bile flow is disrupted, leading to a buildup of bile acids in the bloodstream. This condition typically arises between the 20th and 37th weeks of pregnancy, potentially affecting the pregnancy's normal progression.

The exact cause of cholestasis of pregnancy is unclear, but genetics may play a significant role. Women with a family history of the condition or those with multiple pregnancies are at higher risk. Cholestasis of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of stillbirth and preterm birth, often necessitating specialized neonatal care.

To manage this condition and minimize risks, healthcare providers may prescribe medications to reduce itching and may recommend early delivery, typically between the 36th and 37th weeks. Close monitoring and medical supervision are essential to ensure the health and safety of both mother and baby.

SYMPTOMS OF INTRAHEPATIC CHOLESTASIS OF PREGNANCY (ICP)
Symptoms Of Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP)

The most common and characteristic symptom of ICP is severe itching (pruritus), often affecting the palms and soles and is typically worse at night.
Other symptoms and signs that can occur with ICP include:
Nausea
Dark urine
Pale stool
Fatigue
Loss of appetite
Right upper abdominal pain
Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes), but this is less commonMild itch with a rash

Note:Pregnancy-related ICP might not begin with a rash, but itching can cause one. There's also a similar condition called PUPPS that causes itching and rashes. If you itch and develop a rash, ask for a bile acid test to rule out ICP and get the right care for you and your baby.

CAUSES OF INTRAHEPATIC CHOLESTASIS OF PREGNANCY (ICP)
Causes Of Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP)

The exact cause of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) remains complex and not fully understood. However, several factors, including genetics, hormones, and environmental influences, may contribute to its development.

The liver produces bile, which aids in the digestion of fats, which is stored in the gallbladder. Cholestasis occurs when there is a slowdown or blockage of bile movement, leading to its accumulation in the liver. This buildup of bile eventually causes bile acids to enter the bloodstream, which is thought to trigger the symptoms and complications associated with ICP.

Several factors likely play a role in the development of ICP:

1. Genetic predisposition:In some cases, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) seems to have a hereditary component. Certain gene mutations linked to pregnancy-related cholestasis have been identified.

2. Hormonal influence:Pregnancy hormones like estrogen and progesterone impact gallbladder function, potentially slowing or halting bile flow. Bile, accumulating in the liver, can enter the bloodstream. Notably, higher-risk groups include women with multiples, those who underwent IVF, and those with prior liver conditions.

RISK FACTORS FOR INTRAHEPATIC CHOLESTASIS OF PREGNANCY (ICP)
Risk Factors For Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP)

Several factors can potentially trigger or exacerbate ICP, including:

Previous history of ICP:Women who have experienced intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) in a previous pregnancy have a high recurrence risk, with over an 80% likelihood of developing it in subsequent pregnancies.

History of hepatitis C infection:Hepatitis C infection has been linked to an increased risk of developing ICP. Both conditions affect the liver, and underlying inflammation and liver function changes may contribute to ICP.

Cholelithiasis (gallstones):The presence of gallstones can interfere with the normal flow of bile, potentially leading to cholestasis and increasing the risk of ICP.

Multiple Pregnancies (twins or More):Women carrying multiple fetuses (twins, triplets, etc.) are at an increased risk of developing ICP compared to those with a singleton pregnancy.


Environmental component:Winter months see more ICP diagnoses. This hints at an environmental factor, possibly reduced sunlight exposure or dietary changes, triggering the condition.

Assisted reproduction:Women who conceive with assisted reproduction techniques have a higher risk of developing ICP compared to those who conceive spontaneously.


Maternal age:Some studies suggest that older maternal age might be a risk factor for developing ICP.

POST-DELIVERY MANAGEMENT
Post-delivery Management

Managing ICP (Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy) after childbirth is crucial and includes:


1. Symptom resolution: Itching (pruritus) and jaundice in ICP often vanish after childbirth due to placental removal, relieving symptoms. Jaundice fades within a week, and itching improves within days.

2. 6-week follow-up:Bile acid and liver function tests are recommended to ensure a return to normal levels. If you had gestational diabetes, a glucose tolerance test should also be done.


3. Persistent liver disease:If liver abnormalities persist after 6 weeks, further testing is necessary to rule out other liver conditions.


4. Breastfeeding:Most women with ICP can breastfeed safely, but it’s essential to discuss this with your doctor, especially if you are on medications.


5. Long-term monitoring:Periodic liver function tests may be advised to ensure ongoing liver health.
Is hormonal contraception safe for women who have experienced ICP?
Yes, hormonal contraception is generally safe for women with a history of ICP. However, if itching reoccurs while using hormonal contraception, further investigation is needed. If liver function is abnormal, considering alternative contraception methods may be recommended.

Here are the most commonly favoured contraceptive methods that are popular among today's generation.

COMPLICATIONS OF INTRAHEPATIC CHOLESTASIS OF PREGNANCY (ICP)
Complications Of Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP)

Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy primarily affects the mother but can also pose risks to the fetus. Here are some potential complications:

MATERNAL COMPLICATIONS
Maternal Complications


Increased risk of preterm labor:ICP may be linked to a higher risk of preterm labor (labor that begins early, before 37 weeks of pregnancy), particularly in women with previous ICP episodes or multiple pregnancies.

Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH):This rare but serious condition involves heavy bleeding after delivery. Women with ICP may have a slightly increased risk of PPH.
FETAL COMPLICATIONS

Fetal Complications


Preterm Birth:ICP is associated with a higher risk of preterm birth, which can lead to respiratory distress syndrome and developmental issues for the newborn.

Stillbirth:ICP increases the risk of stillbirth, potentially due to bile acid accumulation affecting placental function and causing fetal distress.

Fetal distress:Elevated bile acids in the mother can affect fetal heart rate patterns, potentially leading to fetal distress.

Meconium passage:Stress from ICP may cause the fetus to pass meconium (a newborn's first poop) into the amniotic fluid. This can lead to meconium aspiration syndrome, where the baby inhales meconium-stained fluid, resulting in respiratory problems.

Neonatal breathing issues:Elevated bile acids can hinder surfactant production, leading to Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) in the newborn, who may require respiratory support.

Note:Recent research suggests that very high bile acid levels may alter the baby’s heart rhythm (arrhythmia) and, in extreme cases, cause it to stop.

Keep your pregnancy on track by monitoring bile acid levels to ensure both you and your baby.
