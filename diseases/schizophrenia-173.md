CAUSES OF SCHIZOPHRENIA
Causes Of Schizophrenia


There is no single established cause of schizophrenia.
It can be caused by a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and neurochemical factors.
Imbalances in brain neurotransmitters like dopamine and glutamate, along with structural brain abnormalities, contribute to its development.
There are several factors that can play a role in the development of this condition which are discussed in the next segment.

RISK FACTORS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA
Risk Factors Of Schizophrenia


Certain factors increase a person’s risk of developing schizophrenia, are:


1. NON-MODIFIABLE FACTORS
1. Non-modifiable factors
Age
Gender (more common in men)
Family history of schizophrenia (though no single gene is directly linked)
Pregnancy and birth complications.

Note:The symptoms of schizophrenia usually start between the age of 16 - 30 years.
Interestingly, men tend to experience their first episode of schizophrenia in their late teens to early 20s, whereas women typically experience their first episode in their late 20s or early 30s.


2. ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
2. Environmental factors
Stress
Exposure to toxins or viruses that affect brain development in early life or before birth
Infections likeinfluenza (flu)orherpes
Autoimmune diseases
Consumption of psychoactive drugs during teen years or early adulthood


3. SOCIAL FACTORS
3. Social factors
Childhood trauma
Social isolation
Stressful events in life.Did you know?
The risk of schizophrenia is around 10% if a person has a first-degree relative with the condition and around 3% if they have a second-degree relative. If both parents suffer from schizophrenia, then there is a 40% chance that the kid might suffer from the condition.
DIAGNOSIS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA
Diagnosis Of Schizophrenia


Schizophrenia is suspected after a major psychotic episode with other symptoms. Diagnosis requires ruling out other psychiatric, substance-induced, or medication-related disorders. It consists of:


1. HISTORY AND CLINICAL EXAMINATION
1. History and Clinical Examination
A physician conducts a thorough examination, reviews the patient’s history, and checks for schizophrenia symptoms, social and occupational dysfunction, and health-related complications.
Ruling out other conditions that may mimic schizophrenia is crucial before confirming the diagnosis.
2. LAB TESTS
2. Lab tests
Alcohol screen blood:It is to rule out alcohol intoxication as a cause of psychotic symptoms through blood tests.
Alcohol screen urine:Done to rule out alcohol intoxication as a cause of the psychotic symptoms through urine analysis.
Drugs of abuse panel:It detects the presence or absence of commonly abused psychotic drug abuse as a cause of the psychotic symptoms.
Complete blood count (CBC):Done to evaluate general health status and look for any infections.


3. IMAGING STUDIES
3. Imaging studiesCT scan (brain):To study any structural changes in the brain.

MRI brain:It gives an in-depth study to identify any pathology in the brain that might be causing symptoms.

Criterion B:The level of functioning has to be lowered significantly and for the long term compared to the previously achieved levels.

Criterion C:Signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months, must include criterion A symptoms for at least 1 month.

Criterion D:Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic symptoms must be ruled out.

Criterion E:The disturbance is not caused by substance use or any medical conditions.

Criterion F:If the individual has a history ofautismor communication disorders from childhood, then schizophrenia is diagnosed based on symptoms like delusions and hallucinations lasting over six months, after ruling out other conditions, as outlined in the DSM-5.

TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA
Treatment Of Schizophrenia


Management of schizophrenia consists of:
1. CONVENTIONAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS OR FIRST-GENERATION ANTIPSYCHOTICS
1. Conventional antipsychotics or first-generation antipsychotics
These drugs help to control psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia such as delusions and hallucinations. They work by blocking the action of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain. Examples include:
Chlorpromazine
Haloperidol
Fluphenazine


2. ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS OR SECOND-GENERATION ANTIPSYCHOTICS
2. Atypical antipsychotics or second-generation antipsychotics
These are newer antipsychotic medicines with fewer body movement-related side effects.They work by blocking the receptors for neurotransmitters like serotonin (stronger blocking) and dopamine (moderate blocking). Common examples are:
Aripiprazole
Ziprasidone
Sulpiride
Asenapine
Clozapine

HOME-CARE FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA
Home-Care for Schizophrenia

Support schizophrenia management at home with nutritious foods, herbal supplements, and mindful eating habits. One such diet is ketogenic. A ketogenic diet is a low-carb, high-fat diet that shifts the body into ketosis, where it burns fat for energy instead of carbs.

HOW CAN A KETOGENIC DIET HELP WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA?
How can a ketogenic diet help with schizophrenia?

May reduce symptoms:According to studies gluten-free or low-carb ketogenic diet may help ease schizophrenia symptoms.


Boosts brain health:The diet increases GABA, a neurochemical that supports brain function and may improve schizophrenia symptoms.


Prevents weight gain:Helps manage weight, especially for those with a sedentary lifestyle or medication-related weight gain.

Note:Always consider consulting a professional before making any dietary changes.
COMPLICATIONS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA
Complications of Schizophrenia

If left untreated, Schizophrenia may severely hamper a patient’s quality of life and can potentially cause complications like:
Anxietydisorder

ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA
Alternative Therapies For Schizophrenia

Alternative therapies for schizophrenia can be supportive but should always be used alongside medical treatment and under a doctor's guidance. Therapies that can help include:


1. PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS
1. Psychosocial interventions
In addition to medication, psychological therapy helps normalize the patient’s thought patterns and also helps cope with stress andanxiety.
Social rehabilitation helps the individual interact with society and participate in daily activities.
These are important interventional programs for managing a patient with schizophrenia.


2. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY
2. Cognitive behavior therapy
This type of psychological therapy helps teach the individuals coping skills to manage their difficult conditions.
The therapy focuses on the cognitive component which helps the individual to change their thinking about a particular situation.
3. ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY
3. Electroconvulsive therapy
This is done in rare cases for adults who do not respond well to drug therapy, electroconvulsive therapy, or shock therapy (ECT) may be considered.
In this, small acceptable amounts of electric currents are passed through the brain to help regulate electrical activity in the brain.


4. DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION
4. Deep brain stimulation
This is a type of elective surgical procedure in which tiny incisions are made near the brain to implant some electrodes in the brain.
These electrodes generate mild electrical impulses which are thought to regulate abnormal electrical activity of the brain and improve the symptoms.
