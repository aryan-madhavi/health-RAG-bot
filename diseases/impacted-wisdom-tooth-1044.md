IMPACTED WISDOM TOOTH
Impacted Wisdom ToothAlso known as Impacted third molars
OVERVIEW
Overview
Wisdom teeth, located at the back of the mouth, often emerge later in life and may partially erupt or remain impacted which means they fail to erupt through the gums fully or become trapped within the jawbone. It occurs when the tooth fails to emerge fully or aligns improperly due to a lack of space in the jaw or obstruction by other teeth.


This can lead to symptoms like pain, infection, difficulty in mouth opening, or even cause damage to adjacent teeth. Risk factors for an impacted wisdom tooth include a small jaw, tooth misalignment, overcrowding, genetics, or late tooth eruption.

Treatment for an impacted wisdom tooth typically involves surgical removal to prevent or address pain, infection, or damage to nearby teeth. However, in some cases where the impacted tooth is asymptomatic and unlikely to cause complications, monitoring may be recommended.


Post-surgery care includes managing swelling, pain relief, and maintaining oral hygiene to ensure proper healing.

TYPES OF IMPACTED WISDOM TOOTH
Types Of Impacted Wisdom Tooth

Impacted wisdom teeth are classified based on their growth angle and position relative to adjacent teeth and the jawbone. Common types include:
Mesioangular Impaction:The wisdom tooth is angled toward the front of the mouth, pressing against the second molar.
Vertical Impaction:The tooth is upright but fails to fully emerge through the gum line.
Horizontal Impaction:The tooth lies horizontally in the jaw, pressing against adjacent teeth.
Distoangular Impaction:The tooth is angled toward the back of the mouth, away from the second molar.
Transverse Impaction:The tooth is positioned sideways, at a 90-degree angle to its normal alignment.
Inverted Impaction:The tooth is upside down within the jaw, often requiring complex removal.

Note:Apart from these a soft tissue impaction occurs when a wisdom tooth partially erupts. In contrast, a bony impaction involves the tooth being fully trapped in the jawbone.

CAUSES OF IMPACTED WISDOM TOOTH
Causes Of Impacted Wisdom Tooth


The primary cause of impacted wisdom teeth is evolutionary changes in the human jaw structure.
Over time, as our diets have evolved and dental hygiene practices have improved, the size of the human jaw has become smaller.
This reduction in jaw size often leads to insufficient space for the third molars, or wisdom teeth, to emerge properly.
As a result, the wisdom teeth can become impacted. Here are some specific factors and causes:
Angulation of the tooth
Late eruption
Crowded teeth
Soft tissue obstruction
RISK FACTORS OF IMPACTED WISDOM TOOTH
Risk Factors of Impacted Wisdom Tooth

The causes and risk factors for impacted wisdom teeth are related but not identical. Common risk factors include:
1. JAW SIZE

1. Jaw Size
Individuals with smaller jaw sizes may have less space for the wisdom teeth to properly emerge, increasing the risk of impaction. Factors that affect the jaw size include:
Feeding habits in infancy
Childhood habits like thumb sucking
Cross-breeding
High sugar consumption
2. AGE

2. Age
Wisdom teeth typically begin to emerge in the late teens or early twenties. The age at which the teeth start to come in can influence the likelihood of impaction.
3. POOR DENTAL HYGIENE

3. Poor Dental Hygiene
Inadequate oral hygiene can lead to gum disease and infections, which may affect the proper eruption of wisdom teeth.

DIAGNOSIS OF IMPACTED WISDOM TOOTH
Diagnosis Of Impacted Wisdom Tooth

Diagnosis of an impacted wisdom tooth typically involves the following:
1. CLINICAL EXAMINATION

1. Clinical Examination
A dentist or oral surgeon will begin by conducting a thorough clinical examination of the mouth, teeth, and surrounding tissues.
They will assess for signs and symptoms associated with impacted wisdom teeth, such as pain, swelling, redness, difficulty opening the mouth, and evidence of infection.
2. IMAGING TESTS

2. Imaging Tests
X-rays:Dental X-rays, likeTMJ X-raysor periapical X-rays, help assess wisdom teeth's position, angulation, and proximity to other teeth, and detect issues like cysts or abscesses.
CBCT Scan:A cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan may be recommended for detailed 3D imaging of an impacted tooth and surrounding structures, aiding in precise treatment planning for complex cases.

PREVENTION OF IMPACTED WISDOM TOOTH
Prevention Of Impacted Wisdom Tooth


The impaction of wisdom teeth cannot always be prevented, as it often depends on factors like genetics, jaw size, and tooth alignment.
However, maintaining good oral hygiene and regular dental check-ups can help monitor wisdom tooth development and address potential issues early.
Early removal of wisdom teeth showing signs of misalignment or lack of space in the jaw may prevent complications associated with impaction.

TREATMENT OF IMPACTED WISDOM TOOTH
Treatment Of Impacted Wisdom Tooth

The treatment of an impacted wisdom tooth depends on various factors, including the severity of impaction, symptoms, and the individual's overall oral health. Here are common treatment options:
1. OBSERVATION
1. Observation
In cases where the impacted wisdom tooth is not causing any symptoms,the dentist may recommend a wait-and-see approach.
Regular monitoring through dental check-ups and X-rays can help track any changes in the condition of the impacted tooth.
2. EXTRACTION
2. Extraction
The most common treatment for an impacted wisdom tooth is surgical extraction.
This involves removing the impacted tooth surgically under local anesthesia or sedation.
Depending on the position and complexity of the impaction, the dentist or oral surgeon may need to perform a simple extraction or a more complex surgical extraction.
3. PREVENTIVE EXTRACTION
3. Preventive Extraction
Some dentists may recommend preventive extraction of impacted wisdom teeth, even if they are not currently causing symptoms.
This proactive approach helps prevent potential future problems such as infection, damage to neighboring teeth, gum disease, and cyst formation.
4. MEDICATIONS
4. Medications
Antibiotics:If an impacted wisdom tooth shows signs of infection or inflammation, antibiotics may be prescribed to manage symptoms temporarily. Commonly used ones are:
Amoxycillin
Clindamycin
Metronidazole

Analgesics (Pain relief):Over-the-counter pain medications may be recommended to manage pain and discomfort associated with an impacted wisdom tooth. Common ones include:
Ibuprofen
Paracetamol

4. OTHER PROCEDURES
4. Other Procedures
Operculectomy:If a wisdom tooth is partially erupted but blocked by thick gum tissue, this procedure removes the tissue to help the tooth erupt. If the tooth still doesn't emerge fully, removal might be needed.

AutogenousTransplantation: Third molars can be moved to another site, like a missing first molar's spot. However, this is rarely done due to a low success rate, except in special cases.

Orthodontically Guided Eruption: This technique uses braces to help impacted teeth, like canines or premolars, move into the correct position in the dental arch.

Eruption-Activating Procedures:These methods are applied to developing teeth to encourage their eruption into the correct position.

COMPLICATIONS OF IMPACTED WISDOM TOOTH
Complications Of Impacted Wisdom Tooth


Impacted wisdom teeth can lead to various complications, and if left untreated, these issues can become more severe. Common complications of impacted wisdom teeth include:


Pericoronitis:It is an inflammation of the soft tissues surrounding a partially erupted or impacted tooth, commonly a wisdom tooth. It occurs when food debris, plaque, or bacteria get trapped under the gum flap, leading to infection.


Gum disease (Periodontitis):Impacted wisdom teeth can create pockets where bacteria can accumulate and lead to inflammation of the gums.


Cysts and tumors:Impacted wisdom teeth can sometimes lead to the formation of cysts (fluid filled cavities) or tumors around the impacted tooth. These abnormalities can damage surrounding bone and tissues.


Damage to adjacent teeth:Wisdom teeth may push against adjacent teeth as they try to emerge, causing misalignment or damage to nearby teeth.


Abscess formation:Untreated infections around impacted teeth can lead to the formation of abscesses, which are pockets of pus.


Sinus issues:Impacted upper wisdom teeth can sometimes affect the sinus cavity, leading to sinus pain, pressure, or sinus infections.


Difficulty in cleaning:Proper oral hygiene around impacted wisdom teeth can be challenging, increasing the risk of decay and infection.


Speech and chewing problems:Impacted wisdom teeth can cause discomfort and difficulty in speaking or chewing.

Note:If you are experiencing any of these issues it is better to get the impacted wisdom tooth removed.Did you know?
