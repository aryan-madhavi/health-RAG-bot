HICCUPS
Hiccups:Also known as Hiccough and Singultus
OVERVIEW
Overview


Almost every one of us must have experienced hiccups in our lifetime.

A hiccup is a repeated involuntary contraction of the diaphragm (the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen) followed by a sudden closure of the vocal cords. This checks the inflow of air and produces the characteristic “snap” or “hic” sound.

Eating or drinking too quickly, having very hot or freezing foods, spicy food, alcohol and carbonated beverages are common causes of getting hiccups. Babies also may get hiccups after feeding, crying or coughing. However, many times a reason for hiccups cannot be identified.

Hiccups are usually harmless and settle by themselves in a few minutes. Breath-holding, drinking a glass of water or eating sugar are common ways to stop hiccups.

However, in some cases, prolonged hiccups that last for days or weeks may be suggestive of some underlying disorder. It is essential to identify the cause and treat it accordingly.

SYMPTOMS OF HICCUPS
Symptoms of Hiccups

The only symptom of hiccups is a slight tightening sensation in your chest, abdomen, or throat that causes the hiccup sound.

The hiccup reflex involves the synchronized action of the
Diaphragm: It is a large muscle located below the lungs that demarcates the chest from the abdomen. It contracts rhythmically and continually to aid in respiration.
The muscles that open and close the windpipe
The nerves that act upon the diaphragm

If any of the nerves involved in this cycle are triggered, for whatever reason, the diaphragm may contract involuntarily, allowing the air to be drawn into the lungs. As a result, epiglottis( the top of the windpipe) closes, resulting in the distinctive cough-like ‘hic’ hiccup sound.
TYPES OF HICCUPS
Types of Hiccups

On the basis of the duration hiccups can be classified as:

Acute hiccups: Less than 48 hours duration
Persistent hiccups: Last over 2 days
Intractable hiccups: Last over a month
CAUSES OF HICCUPS
Causes of Hiccups

I. COMMON CAUSES OF ACUTE HICCUPS:
I. Common causes of acute hiccups:Eating too quickly or too muchEating very hot or very cold foodsConsuming spicy foodDrinking alcohol and carbonated beveragesSwallowing air with chewing gum or sucking on candyIndigestionBad odorInhaling toxic fumesCigarette smokingOver-stretching the neckSudden temperature changesFeeling nervous or excited

II. CAUSES OF PERSISTENT AND INTRACTABLE HICCUPS:

II. Causes of persistent and intractable hiccups:1. Nerve damage or irritation
Conditions that may cause damage or irritation to the nerves that control the diaphragm including Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease(GERD), sore throat, goiter, tumor or cyst.2. Medications
Certain medications can cause hiccups, such as-Antibiotics likeazithromycinPsychiatric medications likearipiprazoleAnesthetic drugs likepropofolSteroidsCertain epilepsy medications3. Instrumentation
Certain procedures that require the use of instruments can mechanically irritate the nerves that control the diaphragm and induce hiccups. For eg. abdominal or chest surgery .
4. Other medical conditions
Some of the conditions that may prompt frequent or prolonged attacks of hiccups include:

Oesophagitis (inflammation of the food pipe)Anoveractive thyroid glandPleurisy (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the lungs)Pneumonia(inflammation of the lungs)TuberculosisInfluenza (flu)Pericarditis (inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart)DiabetesMalariaHerniaUremia (increased levels of waste products in blood)Hypocalcemia(deficiency of calcium)Chronickidney failureMultiple sclerosisStrokeCancer


III. CAUSES OF HICCUPS IN INFANTS
III. Causes of Hiccups in Infants
It is prevalent for babies under 12 months to get hiccups. Newborns and infants may experience hiccups more frequently during or after feeding as they may swallow food too quickly or overfeed.

This can lead to stomach distension, and when the stomach distends, it pushes against the diaphragm, which causes it to contract and cause hiccups.

Hiccups can be a sign of an infant being full. Therefore, pediatricians typically recommend short feeds with burping breaks.

Your baby will usually stop hiccupping within 5 to 10 minutes, but if your baby's hiccups do not stop within a couple of hours, you should see your doctor.

Note:Generally, hiccups are a sign of healthy growth and development.Did you know ?Babies often hiccup in the womb before they are born. In most cases, fetal hiccups are completely normal and not a cause for concern. They usually indicate that the baby’s respiratory and nervous systems are developing well, as are their reflexes.

DIAGNOSIS OF HICCUPS
Diagnosis of Hiccups


No specific test is required in the diagnosis of hiccups, but in the case of persistent or intractable hiccups, it is important to detect any probable underlying illness.
1. HISTORY
1. History
A physician may ask for the history of the current sickness that includes the length of the hiccups, any treatments used, and their relevance to a recent condition or operation. They may also ask about your past medical history, including information about known gastrointestinal and neurologic disorders, and drug history that also includes details concerning alcohol use.

2. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
2. Physical examination
During the physical exam, the doctor may perform a neurological exam to check your-
Balance and coordination
Muscle strength and tone
Reflexes
Sight and sense of touch

3. LABORATORY TESTING
3. Laboratory testing
While no specific evaluation is required for acute hiccups, the following lab tests might be suggested for diagnosis of long term hiccups:
Serum electrolytes
Calcium test
Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test
Creatinine test
Lipase
Liver function tests

4. IMAGING TECHNIQUES
4. Imaging techniques
These  tests may help to identify abnormalities inside the chest, neurological changes or lesions causing hiccups.ECG (Electrocardiogram)Chest radiographComputerized tomography (CT)Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)

SPECIALISTS TO VISIT
Specialists To Visit

The majority of hiccup bouts are self-limiting and pass quickly. However, if they persist even after 2 days, it can be because of an underlying condition. Doctors that can help diagnose and treat hiccups include:

General physicians
Otolaryngologists
Gastroenterologists
Neurologists
Pulmonologists

An otorhinolaryngologist is a surgical doctor for the management of conditions of the head and neck.

A gastroenterologist is specialized in the diagnosis and treatment of the gastrointestinal tract disorders.

A neurologist specializes in the treatment of disorders affecting the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. A pulmonologist is a doctor who treats disorders of the lungs.

TREATMENT OF HICCUPS
Treatment of Hiccups

The doctor will want to know if your hiccups are caused by a medical condition or medication you are taking. If the underlying problem is treated or you switch medications, the hiccups should go away. The underlying cause determines the pharmacological treatment, which may include:
I. MEDICATIONS BASED ON SPECIFIC CAUSES:
I. Medications based on specific causes:

1. For nasal symptoms:Nebulized 0.9% saline (2 mls over 5 minutes)

2. To reduce gastric irritation:Proton pump inhibitors can be given. They include:
Omeprazole
Pantoprazole
Lansoprazole

Metoclopramide
Domperidone
Itopride


4. Antiflatulent:These medications are used to treat or prevent excessive intestinal gas. They include-
Simethicone
Peppermint water
Carminative agent
II. MEDICATIONS FOR INTRACTABLE HICCUPS

II. Medications for Intractable Hiccups

1. Dopamine antagonists:These medicines can relax the diaphragm muscle or its
nerve supply and may stop persistent hiccups. They include:
HaloperidolOlanzapineChlorpromazineMethylphenidate



2. GABA agonist:Baclofenis the medication of choice as it helps relax muscles.

Note:Caution is advised in the elderly and patients with kidney dysfunction.

3. Local anesthetic:Low-dose oflignocaineinfusion or nebulization help stop hiccups.

4. Antiepileptic:These help relax the nerve supply to the diaphragm and relieve hiccups. The most commonly used drugs include:
GabapentinSodium valproate



5. Calcium channel blocker:These blockers, such asnifedipine, can help control hiccups.


III. INVASIVE PROCEDURES
III. Invasive procedures

More invasive options might be attempted only in case of extreme cases of hiccups. These include the following:Nasogastric intubation: Insertion of a tube into the stomach via the nose.Phrenic nerve block:The phrenic nerve which supplies the diaphragm can be blocked using anesthetic medication.Diaphragmatic pacemaker: It is a battery-powered device that can be implanted surgically. It helps to stimulate or pace the nerves supplying to the diaphragm (the phrenic nerve or vagus nerve) and regulating breathing.Did you know?As per a study, rectal massage can also be helpful in relieving intractable hiccups. It can be done by inserting a finger into the rectum and massage using sterile gloves and sufficient lubricant. However, your doctor’s consent should be taken before trying this.

2. MASSAGE

2. Massage
A carotid sinus massage may be suggested to manage chronic hiccups. This involves rubbing the main carotid artery in the neck by the healthcare provider.
LIVING WITH HICCUPS
Living With Hiccups

Hiccups are usually harmless and resolve themselves in a few minutes. Simple home remedies also come in handy to manage them.

However, chronic or prolonged hiccups can be highly stressful, annoying and disrupt daily routines. They can make sleeping difficult or wake you up in the middle of the night. If the condition lasts for a long time, the lack of sleep can cause a loss of energy throughout the day, leading to exhaustion. All these factors can negatively impact a person's quality of life.

To cope with the condition, getting plenty of rest, eating and drinking small amounts regularly, and being aware of potential complications are critical.

Take prescribed medications on time. Keep yourself busy and distracted. Develop a hobby. Join support groups facing the same challenges.

Maintain regular contact with your doctor throughout treatment to avoid the recurrence of hiccups and complications associated with chronic hiccups.Did you know?An interesting case report suggested that a 40-year-old man’s 4 days of continuous hiccuping ceased immediately following sexual intercourse.Did our information help you?In our relentless endeavour to keep improving our services, you are our eyes.
