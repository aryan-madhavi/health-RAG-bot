MUMPS
MumpsAlso known as Parotitis, Viral parotitis, Infective parotitis and Epidemic parotitis
OVERVIEW
Overview
Mumps is a contagious viral infection caused by the paramyxovirus. It spreads easily through respiratory droplets, such as nasal secretions or saliva, when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or shares utensils.

The virus primarily targets the salivary glands, especially the parotid glands near the ears. A hallmark symptom of mumps is the painful swelling of these glands, leading to puffy cheeks and a tender, sensitive jaw. Other common symptoms includefever,headache, muscle aches, fatigue, and loss of appetite.

Mumps is a self-resolving illness that simply runs its course. There is no specific treatment for mumps, and care mainly involves managing symptoms through rest, fluids, and pain relievers.

While most cases are mild, mumps can sometimes cause serious complications. These include inflammation of the testicles (orchitis) in males, which can lead to infertility, inflammation of the ovaries (oophoritis) or breasts (mastitis) in females,meningitis,encephalitis, and hearing loss. Complications are more common in adults than in children.

The MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine is the most effective prevention method and is considered safe and highly effective.

SYMPTOMS OF MUMPS
Symptoms of Mumps

Most children infected with the mumps virus are either asymptomatic or display only mild respiratory symptoms, similar to those of a common cold. When symptoms do occur, they typically appear 7 to 21 days after exposure.

EARLY SYMPTOMS
Early symptoms

These are often seen in both children and adults:
Low to moderate-gradefeverGeneral malaise (a feeling of discomfort or unease)Muscle achesHeadacheLoss of appetite


PROGRESSIVE SYMPTOMS
Progressive symptoms

These may develop a few days after the early signs:
High-grade fever (up to 103°F–104°F or 39.5°C–40°C)Parotitis – swelling and pain in the parotid or other salivary glandsSwollen, tender jawEar painDifficulty in eating, chewing, swallowing (especially sour or acidic foods), or speaking


ABOUT PAROTITIS
About parotitis
Parotitis is the hallmark symptom of mumps.It refers to the inflammation and swelling of the parotid glands, the largest salivary glands located in front of and below the ears.This swelling causes the characteristic puffy cheeks and tender jaw seen in mumps patients.It usually occurs 24 to 48 hours after other early symptoms (fever, headache, muscle aches, etc.), but in some cases, the swelling may not appear until up to a week after initial symptoms.Parotitis can occur on one or both sides of the face (unilateral or bilateral).

CAUSES OF MUMPS
Causes Of Mumps

Mumps is caused by the paramyxovirus, a member of the rubulavirus family.

TRANSMISSION OF THE MUMPS VIRUS
Transmission of the mumps virus

Airborne droplets:The virus spreads when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, releasing droplets into the air that can be inhaled by others.


Direct contact: Mumps can also spread through direct contact with respiratory secretions or saliva, as well as contaminated objects like utensils or cups.


Close contact:The virus is highly contagious in environments where people are in close proximity, such as schools, daycare centers, and households. Close-contact activities like kissing, dancing, or playing sports also facilitate transmission.



INCUBATION PERIOD
Incubation period

After exposure to the mumps virus, symptoms typically appear16 to 18 days later, although this period can range from12 to 25 days.

CONTAGIOUS PERIOD
Contagious period

Patients are most contagious 1–2 days before the onset of symptoms. They can continue spreading the virus at least five days before their salivary glands begin to swell, and they remain contagious for up to one week after the appearance of symptoms.

RISK FACTORS FOR MUMPS
Risk Factors For Mumps

The following factors increase the likelihood of contracting mumps:

1. AGE
1. Age

Children aged 5 to 14 years are at a higher risk, especially those who have not been vaccinated. Although mumps is less common in younger children due to widespread vaccination, older children and adults can still get infected.


2. CLOSE CONTACT ENVIRONMENTS
2. Close contact environments

Mumps spreads easily in close-contact settings such as schools, daycares, colleges, and households. It is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets and saliva, which makes environments where people share utensils, engage in physical activities, or are in close proximity particularly high-risk for outbreaks.


3. WEAKENED IMMUNE SYSTEM
3. Weakened immune system

Individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or those on immunosuppressive medications, are more vulnerable to the mumps virus and may experience more severe complications.


4. TRAVEL TO HIGH-RISK AREAS
4. Travel to high-risk areas

Traveling to regions with low vaccination rates or areas experiencing mumps outbreaks increases the risk of contracting the virus.

5. NON-IMMUNE STATUS
5. Non-immune status

People who have never had mumps or have not received the MMR vaccine are at increased risk, especially adults, who tend to experience more severe symptoms and complications than children.


6. SEASONAL VARIATIONS
6. Seasonal variations

Mumps are most common during late winter and early spring, though they can occur at any time.

DIAGNOSIS OF MUMPS
Diagnosis Of Mumps

Diagnosis of Mumps typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation and laboratory tests. Here's how it is generally diagnosed:

1. CLINICAL EVALUATION
1. Clinical evaluation
The healthcare provider will first assess the symptoms, including the hallmark signs of swollen and tender parotid glands (located near the ears).

Medical history is reviewed, including vaccination status and potential exposure to someone with mumps.



2. LABORATORY TESTS
2. Laboratory tests

If there is a suspicion of mumps, several tests can confirm the diagnosis:

Blood tests:Serology to detect antibodies against the mumps virus (IgM and IgG). A rise inIgMlevels indicates recent infection, while the presence ofIgGshows past exposure or vaccination.

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR):A more accurate test that detects mumps virus RNA in a sample taken directly from buccal (inner cheek) swabs, throat swabs, and saliva, particularly when obtained within 2 days of the appearance of symptoms.

Viral culture:The virus can be isolated from saliva or throat swabs, although this method is less commonly used due to its slower results.

CSF analysis:In case of complications involving the central nervous system (CNS), a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) may be used to rule out other potential causes.



3. IMAGING (IN SOME CASES)
3. Imaging (in some cases)

In rare cases, imaging tests (like ultrasound) may be used to assess swelling of the parotid glands or other complications, such as inflammation of the testicles (orchitis) or ovaries (oophoritis).

PREVENTION OF MUMPS
Prevention Of Mumps

The best way to prevent mumps is through vaccination and adopting good hygiene practices to limit the spread of the virus.

1. MMR VACCINATION
1. MMR vaccination
The MMR vaccine (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) is the most effective prevention method. It is a safe, effective, and essential part of routine childhood immunization.

It is usually given in two doses:First dose at 12–15 months of ageSecond dose at 4–6 years of age



Adults who have not been vaccinated or are unsure of their immunization status should also consider getting the MMR vaccine.
Book Your Vaccination


2. AVOIDING EXPOSURE
2. Avoiding exposure

Stay away from people who are infected with mumps, especially during their contagious period (usually a few days before and after gland swelling begins).
Avoid sharing utensils, drinks, toothbrushes, or personal items that may be contaminated with saliva.



3. PRACTICE GOOD HYGIENE
3. Practice good hygiene

Wash your hands frequently with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

TREATMENT OF MUMPS
Treatment Of Mumps

Mumps is generally a self-limiting illness, and there is no specific antiviral treatment for it. The treatment primarily focuses on relieving symptoms and managing discomfort while the body recovers.

PAIN RELIEF
Pain relief

Over-the-counter pain relievers likeparacetamoloribuprofencan help alleviate headaches, muscle aches, and fever.

Note: DO NOT give aspirin to children, as it has been linked to Reye’s syndrome, a life-threatening disease that can cause liver failure and swelling of the brain.

HOME CARE FOR MUMPS
Home care for Mumps

Mumps is a self-limiting viral illness, and most cases can be managed effectively at home with simple supportive care. Follow these tips to help ease symptoms and prevent the spread of infection:
Isolation:Mumps is contagious, and it’s important to stay home and avoid close contact with others for at least 5 days after the salivary gland swelling begins to prevent the spread of the virus.

Rest:Get plenty of rest to allow your body to recover. Fatigue and muscle aches are common during mumps, so listen to your body and take breaks when needed.
Warm or cold compresses:Applying a warm or cold compress to the swollen glands may help reduce pain and discomfort.
Hydration:Drink plenty of fluids like filtered water, coconut water, soups, etc, to stay hydrated, especially if there’s difficulty eating or drinking due to swelling of the glands.
Dietary adjustments:To ease swallowing difficulties caused by swollen salivary glands, it’s helpful to consume a soft, bland diet. This can include foods like mashed potatoes, oatmeal, yogurt, broth-based soups, or any other items that are easy to swallow and require minimal chewing.

Note: It’s also important to avoid acidic or sour foods, such as citrus fruits and juices, as these can stimulate salivation and worsen pain in the inflamed salivary glands.
