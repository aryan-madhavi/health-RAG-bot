EYE STRAIN
Eye strainAlso known as Asthenopia,  Eye fatigue, Ocular fatigue, Computer Vision Syndrome, Digital Eye Strain
OVERVIEW
Overview
Eye strain is a common condition, especially in today's digital age. It is mainly characterized by discomfort, red, watery eyes, and blurred vision as if looking through a fogged-up window.


It is a common issue that can affect anyone. Spending extended periods in front of screens puts you at risk. Other contributing factors, such as poor lighting, improper viewing distances, and insufficient blinking, also exacerbate symptoms.


Amidst COVID-19, a significant rise in digital eye strain cases was witnessed. The widespread adoption of online education and remote work has underscored the importance of proper screen practices, making it more relevant than ever.


Taking regular breaks, adjusting screen settings, and maintaining proper posture can help prevent eye strain. Individuals with persistent eye strain may require prescription glasses or other interventions to manage the discomfort effectively.

CAUSES OF EYE STRAIN
Causes Of Eye strain

One of the most common causes of eye strain is a computer and digital screen use. Eye strain results from a complex interplay of factors involving the eyes, surrounding muscles, and environmental conditions.

Here's an overview of the key aspects:
1. Fatigue of eye muscles
Prolonged engagement in activities such as reading, screen time, or extended driving strains the extraocular muscles (responsible for eye movement and focus), inducing muscle fatigue.
Additionally, continuous close-up tasks, like reading or computer work, demand constant adjustment and focus from the ciliary muscle (adjusts the shape of the lens in the eye to facilitate focusing on objects at different distances), leading to strain and fatigue over time.

2. Reduced blinking
Intense concentration on screens or close tasks often results in reduced blinking. Blinking is crucial for evenly spreading tears over the cornea. Reduced blinking can cause dry eyes, contributing to eye strain.

3. Blue light exposure
Extensive use of electronic devices emitting blue light, such as computers and smartphones, can induce digital eye strain due to prolonged screen focus and exposure to this specific light wavelength.

4. Poor lighting conditions
Struggling to see in low or inadequate lighting forces the eyes to exert extra effort, resulting in eye strain.

5. Incorrect vision correction
Neglecting prescribed glasses or contact lenses, or using outdated or incorrect prescriptions, forces the eyes to work harder to focus, leading to eye strain.

6. Medical problems
Underlying eye conditions like dry eye syndrome, allergies, or uncorrected refractive errors can contribute to eye strain. Additionally, general fatigue or stress may exacerbate discomfort by reducing the eye’s ability to maintain focus.
7. Environmental factors
Humidity:  Low environmental humidity can contribute to dry eyes, increasing the likelihood of eye strain.
Airflow: Airflow from fans, air conditioners, or heating systems may contribute to dry eyes.

Note:While uncomfortable, eye strain is typically a transient condition that can be alleviated with adequate rest.Did you know?

Online office and school coupled with extended screen time during COVID lockdowns had contributed to a notable uptick in eye strain cases.

RISK FACTORS FOR EYE STRAIN
Risk Factors For Eye strain


Eye strain can affect anyone, but certain factors may increase the likelihood of experiencing it. Risk factors for eye strain include:

1. Excessive digital device usage
Excessive use of smartphones, tablets, computers, or other digital devices with screens can strain the eyes due to prolonged exposure to blue light and reduced blinking.


2. Extensive reading
Jobs that require extensive reading, such as editors, researchers, or writers, may increase the risk of eye strain.

Here are some workplace safety tips to protect your eyes.

3. Vision problems
Individuals with vision problems are more susceptible to eye strain, especially if they need vision correction but don't use it.Farsightedness (Hypermetropia):Difficulty seeing close objects.Nearsightedness (Myopia):Difficulty seeing things at a distance.Astigmatism:Blurred and distorted vision.

Vision problems make it challenging to focus the eyes, leading to strain. The effort to focus both eyes, especially when one has more significant issues than the other, can also contribute to eye strain.


4.Dry eyes
Insufficient eye lubrication, often caused by factors like aging, medications, or environmental conditions, can lead to discomfort and eye strain.


5. Age
As individuals age, it becomes harder to focus on close objects, which increases the risk of eye strain, particularly during prolonged near tasks.


6. Fatigue and lack of sleep
Fatigue, tiredness, stressful lifestyles, and lack of sleep can contribute to eye strain.

Take care of your vision! Invest in good eye care if prolonged screen time or poor ergonomics cause discomfort or strain.
