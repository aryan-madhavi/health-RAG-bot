FEVER
FeverAlso known as pyrexia, elevated temperature
OVERVIEW
Overview
Fever is a body temperature above the normal temperature of 98.6 F (37 C). However, fever is considered medically significant if it is 100.4 F (38.0 C) or higher.


Depending on the cause of the fever, a person may experience other signs and symptoms. Common symptoms accompanying fever include sweating, shivering, headache, dehydration, and muscle aches.

Infections are the major contributor to fever. The other risk factors include hypersensitivity reactions, food allergies, blood transfusion, and certain types of cancer.

In most cases, fever is beneficial, as it helps the body fight off infections. The main reason for managing a fever is to increase patient comfort. Medications like Paracetamol and Ibuprofen are commonly prescribed. However, a severe fever would demand immediate medical intervention.

SYMPTOMS OF FEVER
Symptoms Of Fever

The normal temperature of the human body is approximately 37 degrees Celsius (°C), or 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (°F). It can vary by about 0.5 °C throughout the day.

However, in the case of a fever, the elevation in core body temperature is usually more than 0.5 °C.

Fever is defined as having a measured temperature of 100.4 °F (38°C) or higher. Depending upon the cause, the person may experience other signs and symptoms which include:

Sweating
Shivering
Hot, red, dry skin
Headache
Dehydration
Muscle aches
Loss of appetite
Tiredness
Nausea
Vomiting
Piloerection (goosebumps)
Dizziness
Increase in heart rate
Convulsions
Note:The normal baseline body temperature can vary from person to person. So, it is important to consider it before indicating fever.
TYPES OF FEVER
Types Of Fever

Depending upon the severity, fever can be of following grades:

Low-grade:37.3 to 38.0 °C (99.1 to 100.4 °F)
Moderate-grade:38.1 to 39.0 °C (100.6 to 102.2 °F)
High-grade:39.1 to 41 °C (102.4 to 105.8 °F)

Fever is also described according to its pattern:

Intermittent:Fever is intermittent when elevated but falls to normal (37.2°C or below) daily.
Remittent:Fever is remittent when the temperature falls each day but not to normal.
Hectic:Wide range of temperature; the difference between the lowest and highest temperature is 1.4°C or more. It can be either intermittent or remittent.
Continuous or sustained:A minor change (0.3°C or less) in the elevated temperature during 24 hours.
Relapsing fever:It is a variant of remittent fever in which fever spikes are separated by days or weeks.
CAUSES OF FEVER
Causes Of Fever


Fever is the body’s defense system that fights infection. However, a severe fever may indicate a critical condition requiring immediate medical intervention.
Before understanding the exact cause of fever, it is essential to know about the pyrogens:
Pyrogen is a substance that provokes fever. There are two types of pyrogens:
Exogenous pyrogens:These substances originate from outside the body and can induce endogenous pyrogens. Examples include bacteria, viruses, toxins, and drugs.
Endogenous pyrogens:These are certain substances produced by the body that can induce fever.
Fever occurs through the following steps:
Exogenous pyrogens trigger the release of endogenous pyrogens.
These endogenous pyrogens are transmitted to the thermoregulatory center in the hypothalamus (a part of the brain that controls many body functions).
It induces the synthesis of other chemicals, such as prostaglandins.
These prostaglandins raise the body’s set-point temperature, leading to fever.

Did you know?

Hyperthermia or overheating can also cause a sudden and uncontrolled increase in body temperature (above 41°C). This is usually caused by excessive heat from the surroundings.
However, it is different from fever. In a fever, the hypothalamus increases the body’s set-point temperature. Meanwhile, in hyperthermia, the body’s core temperature rises above the set point due to a thermoregulation failure.
Heat exhaustion and heat stroke are forms of hyperthermia.

3. Blood transfusion
Blood transfusion often triggers an immune response due to mismatch or incompatibility of the transfused product and the recipient. This immune response can cause fever immediately or a few days after the transfusion.

4. MEDICATIONS
4. Medications
Some medications can also cause fever. Drug induced fever most commonly occurs after 7 to 10 days of drug administration. It remains as long as the medication is taken and goes away shortly after discontinuing it. The agents most commonly associated with causing fever include:
Penicillins
Cephalosporins
Antituberculars
Quinidine
Procainamide
Methyldopa
Phenytoin


5.NUTRITIONAL DEFICIENCIES
5.Nutritional deficiencies
Malnourished individuals have weakened immunity, making them more prone to developing fever due to frequent infections.

Here are some tips to prevent nutritional deficiencies in children.

DIAGNOSIS OF FEVER
Diagnosis Of Fever

Diagnosis may involve detailed medical history and lab tests to identify the cause of fever.
1. MEDICAL HISTORY
1. Medical history
A thorough medical history helps identify the exact cause of the fever. The information regarding the following points is captured through patient interaction:
Onset and duration of fever
Degree of temperature
Mode of measuring temperature by the patient
Medications
Mode of measuring temperature
Exposure to any toxins
Recent travel
Recent vaccination


2. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
2. Physical examination
It includes looking for signs such as shock, weak peripheral pulses, increased heart rate, respiratory distress, spots on the skin, discoloration of the skin, and decreased mental status.

3. TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT
3. Temperature measurement
Oral temperature:It is used for cooperative patients older than 4-5 years of age. A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer of 100 °F (37.8 °C) or higher is considered a fever.
Axillary temperature:It only determines the peripheral temperature, not the core body temperature. A temperature reading of >37.2°C (>99°F) is considered high.
Rectal temperature:It measures temperature in children 3 years or younger. A temperature of 38°C (100.4°F) or higher is considered a fever. A special rectal thermometer measures rectal temperature.
Ear (tympanic temperature):In this, the temperature is measured using special tympanic thermometers, or digital ear thermometers. A temperature higher than 37.9°C (100.2°F) is considered fever.
Forehead temperature:The temperature of the forehead is measured using electronic forehead thermometers. These thermometers read the heat waves from the temporal artery (blood vessels that run across the forehead just below the skin). Forehead temperature is usually 0.3 °C (0.5 °F) to 0.6 °C (1 °F) lower than an oral temperature.

The accuracy of all mode of temperature measurement is as follows:

Rectal > Forehead > Oral and Ear > Armpit
