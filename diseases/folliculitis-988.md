FOLLICULITIS
FolliculitisAlso known as Barberâ€™s itch, fungal acne
OVERVIEW
Overview

Folliculitis is a skin condition characterized by the inflammation of hair follicles. It occurs when these small, sac-like structures, which house hair roots, become infected or irritated.


The symptoms typically include red, inflamed bumps or pustules (pus-filled blisters) around hair follicles, often accompanied by itching and pain. Factors that increase the risk of developing folliculitis include excessive sweating, tight clothing, shaving, using hot tubs or whirlpools, and having a weak immune system.


Treatment typically involves self-care measures such as warm compresses, proper hygiene, and avoiding irritants. In more severe cases, antibiotics or antifungal medications may be prescribed.

SYMPTOMS OF FOLLICULITIS
Symptoms Of Folliculitis

Here are some common signs and symptoms. They can vary depending on the severity and the underlying cause.
Cluster of tiny, painful red bumps around hair follicles.
Pus-filled blisters around hair that bleed and crust over.
Rashes
Itching, burning or painful sensation in the skin
Bleeding and crust formation
Growth of stiff hair into the skin
CAUSES OF FOLLICULITIS
Causes Of Folliculitis

Folliculitis frequently arises in moist or sweaty areas and can result from infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal) or irritation due to environmental factors and specific skin conditions. Various causes of folliculitis include:

I. INFECTIONS
I. Infections
1. BacteriaSuperficial bacterial folliculitisis the most common type of bacterial folliculitis caused by the bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus. It usually presents as pustules without fever or other associated symptoms.

Hot tub folliculitisis caused by a bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa, found in contaminated water sources like hot tubs, whirlpools or spas.

Gram negative folliculitisis a rare facial eruption, usually seen after antibiotic treatment of acne.


2. FungiMalassezia folliculitis, often called "fungal acne," in layman terms, is a skin condition caused by an overgrowth of the yeast Malassezia in hair follicles. It results in acne-like pustules and red bumps, often on the chest, back, and face.

Remember!
Do not confuse fungal acne with common acne (acne vulgaris).
Common acne results from blocked follicles due to oil, bacteria, and dead skin, while fungal acne is a yeast-driven infection in follicles.
Fungal acne can be itchy, while typical acne is not.


Tinea capitisor scalp ringworm is a fungal infection involving the hair follicles of the scalp. It is usually associated with scaling and hair loss.


3. Virus
Certain viral infections, such as herpes simplex virus or varicella-zoster virus, can cause folliculitis. It mostly affects men who experience recurrent localized facial herpes simplex infections and shave with a razor.

4. Parasite
Demodex folliculitis is caused by the mite demodex. It occurs on the faces of people whose immune system has been suppressed with medications.

II. ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
II. Environmental Factors
1. Mechanical Folliculitis
Also known as Barber's itch, it results from continuous friction and is often seen in people, who shave their faces or legs with a razor, especially against the hair growth direction.

It can also occasionally be associated with tight clothing or obesity.

Interesting Fact!
Barber's itch is commonly confused with razor bumps. Razor bumps are inflamed, ingrown hairs due to shaving, occurring anywhere on the body, while barber's itch is a fungal infection of hair follicles.

2. Occlusion Folliculitis
It occurs when skin products like heavy oils, moisturizers, or ointments clog hair follicles, leading to swelling and inflammation.

3. Chemical Folliculitis
It occurs when certain topical products, such as coal tars and the overuse of medications like corticosteroids, lead to swelling and blockage of the hair follicle opening, particularly on the face.

III. OTHER FORMS
III. Other Forms
1. Buttock Folliculitis:This common issue affects both men and women, resembling localized acne.

2. Drug-Induced Folliculitis:This type of folliculitis typically arises within two weeks of taking specific medications, such as oral corticosteroids, androgenic hormones, lithium, and certain other anticonvulsants.

3. Pseudofolliculitis Barbae:It's a chronic inflammation affecting the beard area in men who shave, particularly those with darker skin tones and tightly curled hair. The sharp tips of newly grown, curly hair can penetrate the skin, leading to mechanical inflammation.

4. Irritant Folliculitis:It is observed on the lower legs of women who employ methods like shaving, waxing, plucking, or electrolysis for hair removal.

5. Eosinophilic Folliculitis:This type results in severe itching and recurrent lumps and pimples near hair follicles on the face and upper body. It primarily affects individuals living with HIV/AIDS.Did you know the difference between acne and folliculitis?Acne and folliculitis are common skin conditions that can cause similar symptoms, but they have different underlying causes. 
Acne is a chronic inflammatory condition caused by the overproduction of oil, clogged pores, and bacteria. It usually appears as red bumps or pimples on the face, chest, and back. 
Whereas, folliculitis is an infection or inflammation of hair follicles caused by bacteria or fungi. It typically presents as small red bumps with a white center around hair follicles.
Understanding the difference between acne and folliculitis can help in determining appropriate treatment options for each condition.

DIAGNOSIS OF FOLLICULITIS
Diagnosis Of Folliculitis

The diagnosis of folliculitis usually involves the following possible diagnostic steps:
1. MEDICAL HISTORY
1. Medical history
Your doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms, their duration, and any factors that may contribute to the condition.
They may inquire about your recent exposure to hot tubs, swimming pools, or other potential sources of bacteria or fungi.
The doctor may also ask if you have any medical conditions, use of immunosuppressive medications, or recent antibiotics.


2. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
2. Physical examination
The doctor will examine the affected area of your skin. They may look for signs such as redness, pustules (small pus-filled bumps), or crusts.
The examination will help differentiate folliculitis from other skin conditions with similar symptoms.


3. TESTS
3. Tests
In more severe situations, your doctor may request additional tests to ensure that your folliculitis is not caused by another medical issue, such as:


Culture test:A sample of the affected skin may be collected for laboratory testing to identify the specific bacteria or fungi causing the infection.


Skin biopsy:In rare cases, a small sample of the affected skin may be taken for microscopic examination to rule out other skin disorders.

COMPLICATIONS OF FOLLICULITIS
Complications Of Folliculitis

While most cases of folliculitis are mild and resolve on their own, certain complications can arise in more severe or persistent cases.
Here are some possible complications of folliculitis:

1. Furuncles and carbuncles:Furuncles are large, painful boils that occur when the infection spreads to the surrounding tissues. Carbuncles are a cluster of interconnected furuncles.

2. Cellulitis:If folliculitis spreads to the surrounding skin, it can lead to cellulitis, a bacterial skin infection that causes redness, warmth, swelling, and pain.

3. Abscess formation:In some cases, folliculitis can lead to the formation of abscesses, which are pockets of pus within the skin.

4. Scarring and hyperpigmentation:Severe or chronic folliculitis can cause scarring and hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin) in the affected areas.

5. Recurrent or chronic folliculitis:In some individuals, folliculitis may become a recurrent or chronic condition, leading to repeated episodes of inflammation and infection.

6. Spread of Infection:Although rare, folliculitis can potentially spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system. This can result in more serious infections, such as bloodstream infections (bacteremia) or deep tissue infections.

A robust immunity is the key to fighting any infection.
