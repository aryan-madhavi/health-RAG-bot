VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY
Vitamin D deficiencyAlso known as Hypovitaminosis D and Low Vitamin D
OVERVIEW
Overview
Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a vital role in many bodily processes.

Vitamin D deficiency can occur due to less sun exposure, dark skin, physical blocking of sun rays, diet lacking Vitamin D, obesity, and certain conditions and medications that interfere with Vitamin D absorption.

Symptoms of Vitamin D deficiency may not occur for several months or years. Some of the common symptoms may include fatigue and tiredness, bone and muscle pain, loss of appetite, hair loss.

This condition is usually managed with supplements. Sun exposure and eating a vitamin D-rich diet, including fatty fish and fortified dairy products also play a vital role.

CAUSES OF VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY
Causes Of Vitamin D Deficiency

Some of the common causes of vitamin D deficiency include:
Inadequate vitamin D synthesis in the skin
Insufficient dietary intake of vitamin D
Poor absorption of vitamin D from food
Vitamin D is not converted to its active form
Certain medications that interfere with the body's ability to convert or absorb vitamin D

Various risk factors associated with these causes are discussed in the next section.
RISK FACTORS FOR VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY
Risk Factors For Vitamin D Deficiency

Some of the most common risk factors associated with vitamin D deficiency are discussed as follows:
INADEQUATE VITAMIN D SYNTHESIS IN THE SKIN
Inadequate vitamin D synthesis in the skin

1. Decreased sun exposure
Reduced exposure to sunlight is a major risk factor of Vitamin D deficiency. Research suggests that 20 minutes of sunshine daily with over 40% of the skin exposed is required to avoid vitamin D deficiency.

2. Deeper skin tone
Individuals with deeper skin tones or darker skin produce less vitamin D with the same amount of sunlight exposure than individuals with lighter skin color.

3. Staying and working indoors
If an individual is staying home almost all the time and hardly going out during the day they are more prone to vitamin D deficiency.

4. Working overnight shifts
Those working in night shifts can be at a higher risk factor for vitamin D deficiency, because of less opportunity for sunlight exposure compared with daytime workers.

5. Old age
Most old aged individuals spend the majority of their time indoors, getting minimal exposure to natural sunlight. Additionally, as skin thins with age, vitamin D synthesis becomes less efficient.

6. Physical blocking of sunlight
Full coverage clothing and use of sunscreens can decrease the amount of vitamin D production in the skin in cases of severe sun protection.
7. Geographic factors
The following geographic factors may limit sun exposure and affect Vitamin D production
-Higher latitude (living far away from the equator)
-Lower altitude (less distance from sea level)
-Winter season
-Air pollution
-Cloud-shading

INADEQUATE DIETARY INTAKE OF VITAMIN D
Inadequate dietary intake of vitamin D

1. Unbalanced diet
Inadequate intake of vitamin D rich foods like milk, dairy and animal-based sources like fish and fish oils, egg yolks, fortified milk, and beef liver etc is a major risk factor for Vitamin D deficiency.

2. Vegetarian diet
Vegetarian diet that includes only plant-based fare and no animal products is also linked to vitamin D deficiency.

3. Eating disorders

Eating disorders likeanorexia nervosa,bulimia nervosaare strongly associated with Vitamin D deficiency and decreased bone density.

4. Medically restricted diets
Individuals who are on medically restricted diets due to certain medical conditions are at the highest chance of various nutrient deficiencies including vitamin D deficiency.

5. Fad diets
A fad diet is a popular dietary pattern known to be a quick fix for obesity but for long-term weight loss. These diets do not promote a healthy and sustainable diet and lifestyle habits. Certain fad diets eliminate food groups that contain vitamin D and hence, increase the risk of its deficiency.

6.Lactose intolerance
Various studies have shown that individuals who are genetically intolerant to lactose (the sugar present in milk) may suffer from a vitamin D deficiency. This has to do with dietary restriction of milk and dairy products rich in Vitamin D.

POOR ABSORPTION OF VITAMIN D FROM FOOD
Poor absorption of vitamin D from food

1. Medical conditions
Various medical conditions interfere with the absorption of Vitamin D from the diet. Some egs. include:
-Intestinal malabsorption (Celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis)
-Pancreatic insufficiency (Cystic fibrosis)
-Cholestasis syndrome (Biliary atresia)


2. Gut resection or small bowel resection
This surgery is done to remove a part of the small bowel when it is blocked or diseased. This negatively impacts the absorption of Vitamin D from food.

3. Weight loss surgeries
Weight-loss surgeries such as gastric bypass surgery, reduce the size of the stomach. This can lead to poor absorption of Vitamin D.

GENETIC OR ENDOCRINE DISORDERS

Genetic or endocrine disorders
The following conditions have a strong link with Vitamin D deficiency:
Chronic liver diseases
Kidney diseases
Hyperparathyroidism
Growth hormone deficiency
Diabetes mellitus
Hereditary resistance of vitamin D

Note:Research has shown that the genetic influence on vitamin D levels is estimated to be around 80%, which is much higher than the dietary and environmental influences of around 25%.


CERTAIN MEDICATIONS
Certain medications
Certain medications can lower vitamin D levels by activating the degradation of vitamin D. These include:
Steroids (such asprednisolone,dexamethasone)
Anti-seizure drugs (such ascarbamazepine,topiramate,phenobarbitone, andphenytoin)
Tuberculosis drugs ( such asrifampicin)
Cholesterol-lowering drugs (such ascholestyramineand colestipol).
Antifungal agents (Ketoconazole)
Antiretroviral drugs for treating HIV
PERINATAL FACTORS

Perinatal factors

1. Breastfed infants
Infants who are exclusively breastfed but do not receive supplemental vitamin D or adequate sunlight exposure are at increased risk of developing vitamin D deficiency and rickets.

2. Maternal vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy
Vitamin D deficiency is observed in both pregnant women and newborn infants. Maternal vitamin D deficiency can lead to deficiency in their newborn baby and has been linked with various complications during pregnancy and delivery.


OTHER FACTORS
Other factors
1. Smoking
Vitamin D deficiency is higher among smokers. Research studies have shown that smoking may affect the gene that activates the production of vitamin D-3 in the body.

Tips To Quit SmokingDid you know?
There is an inverse relationship between vitamin D levels and BMI. A high BMI is indicative of  obesity. It is hypothesized that excessive fat cells absorb the fat-soluble vitamin D, reducing its availability. Another hypothesis explains that the low Vitamin D concentrations are due to the fact that obese people are less active physically, which entails a decrease in sun exposure.

DIAGNOSIS OF VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY
Diagnosis Of Vitamin D Deficiency
HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

History and physical examination
During screenings for vitamin D deficiency, a medical practitioner analyzes the potential risk factors and the personal health history. Various signs and symptoms of vitamin D deficiency are evaluated.
BLOOD TESTS
Blood tests
Simple blood tests can be useful in determining the levels of vitamin D in the blood.25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OH D), or calcidiol:The 25-(OH)D serum concentration is widely accepted as the best indicator of vitamin D status in individuals.

1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25(OH)2 D), or calcitriol :This test measures the bioactive form of vitamin D.The serum concentration of the active hormone 1α,25-(OH)2D does not provide enough information on the vitamin D status.

The 25-(OH)D has an almost 1000-fold greater concentration than 1,25-(OH)2D; and has a longer half-life of 20 days and hence is more stable in the circulation. Therefore, total-body vitamin D stores are best measured by assessing the circulating levels of 25-(OH)D.

IMAGING TESTS
Imaging tests
Bone X-rays:This imaging test can be advised if the doctor suspects that the patient may have bone weakness and softness.
Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan:This test helps in measuring bone mineral density in patients with chronic vitamin D deficiency.
PREVENTION OF VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY
Prevention Of Vitamin D Deficiency

Vitamin D deficiency can be prevented by adhering to its Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA).
RDA of vitamin D indicates daily intake that is sufficient to maintain bone health and normal calcium metabolism in healthy people. It is listed in both micrograms (mcg) and international units (IU). 1 mcg vitamin D is equal to 40 IU.

RDA according to various age groups is as follows:
0-12 months:400 IU (10 mcg)
1-70 years:600 IU (15 mcg)
> 70 years:800 IU (20mcg)

SOME TIPS FOR AVOIDING VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY INCLUDE:
Some tips for avoiding Vitamin D deficiency include:

1. Do not shy away from the sun
Research shows that approximately 5–30 minutes of sun exposure, particularly between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., either daily or at least twice a week to the face, arms, hands, and legs without sunscreen usually leads to sufficient vitamin D synthesis.


2. Consume vitamin D-containing foods
Try to include these foods regularly as part of a healthy balanced diet to top up your vitamin D levels.
Fatty fish – salmon, sardines, pilchards, tuna, mackerel
Sea foods oysters, shrimp
Red meat and liver
Mushrooms
Egg yolks
Cod liver oil
Soya products


3. Include fortified foods containing vitamin D.


Cow’s milk, almond, and oat milk.
Breakfast cereals.
Other dairy products, such as yogurt.
Orange juice


4. Maintain a healthy body weight
Maintaining a healthy body weight and avoiding being overweight can help maintain the vitamin D levels. Cycling and exercising regularly outside the house can both help in maintaining a healthy weight and sun exposure.


5. Treat underlying medical conditions
People with underlying health conditions such as celiac disease and cystic fibrosis affect the absorption of nutrients. Therefore treating the underlying condition may help in boosting the level of certain nutrients, including vitamin D.Did you know?
Tanning booths are not therapies for vitamin D deficiency.
Sunlight is composed of Ultraviolet A (UV A) and UV B but only UV B is required for vitamin D deficiency. The tanning booths use UV A as the major light source and hence do not help in Vitamin D deficiency. On the contrary, they can lead to the development of skin cancer.

TREATMENT OF VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY
Treatment Of Vitamin D Deficiency

The treatment of vitamin D deficiency is by taking vitamin D supplements. The form of vitamin D that is taken is called ergocalciferol or calciferol. Vitamin D can be given in various forms such as injectables or as a medicine (liquid or tablets). The doctor will discuss the dose and the best treatment schedule, depending on the severity, age, and situation.
SUPPLEMENTS
Supplements
Both D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol) are available as dietary supplements. They  are well absorbed in the gut.

Both  D2 and D3 raise serum 25(OH)D levels, however, most studies indicate that vitamin D3 increases serum 25(OH)D levels to a greater extent and maintains these higher levels longer than vitamin D2.

1. For the initial supplementationit is recommended to takeVitamin D3for eight weeks either 6,000 IU daily or 50,000 IU weekly can be considered.

Note:Once the serum vitamin D exceeds 30 ng/mL, a daily maintenance dose of 1,000 to 2,000 IU is recommended.

2. For high-risk adultswho are vitamin D deficient due to an underlying condition, a higher dose of initial supplementation of Vitamin D3 at 10,000 IU daily is needed.

Note:Once serum vitamin D level exceeds 30 ng/mL, 3000 to 6000 IU/day maintenance dose is recommended.

3. Childrenhaving vitamin D deficiency require 1000 IU/day of vitamin D3 or 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 once weekly for 6 weeks.

Note:Once the serum vitamin D  level exceeds 30 ng/mL, only 1000 IU/day maintenance treatment is recommended.
