GINGIVITIS
GingivitisAlso known as Periodontitis, Bleeding gums
OVERVIEW
Overview

Gingivitis is the early stage of gum disease, where the gums surrounding the teeth become inflamed. It occurs due to the buildup of plaque—a bacteria-filled film—on the teeth and gums. Poor oral hygiene, such as insufficient brushing and flossing, is a leading cause of this condition.

Common signs of gingivitis include red, swollen, and tender gums. Individuals with gingivitis may also experience bleeding while brushing or flossing and bad breath caused by bacteria in the mouth.

Several factors can contribute to the development of gingivitis, including smoking, diabetes, hormonal changes, certain medications, and genetics. Although often painless, untreated gingivitis can progress to more severe gum diseases and may eventually lead to tooth loss.

To prevent and manage gingivitis, maintaining a solid oral hygiene routine is crucial. This includes regular brushing with fluoride toothpaste, daily flossing, and using antimicrobial mouthwash. Professional dental cleanings and check-ups are essential for removing plaque and assessing gum health. Consistent care can reverse gingivitis and promote long-term gum health.

TYPES OF GINGIVITIS
Types Of Gingivitis

Gingivitis, which is a common and mild form of gum disease, can present in different types based on its causes and characteristics. Here are some common types of gingivitis:


1. Plaque-induced gingivitis
This type is caused by plaque buildup due to poor oral hygiene. Misaligned teeth, poorly fitting dental prostheses, and systemic conditions like leukemia can also increase the risk.

2. Infectious gingivitis
This type results from allergic reactions to substances like chewing gum or toothpaste, or from oral infections and injuries such as fractured teeth.

3. Nutritional gingivitis
This type is triggered by vitamin C deficiency and diets high in refined carbohydrates. It activates inflammation and oxidative stress, worsening gum health.

4. Drug-Induced Gingival Overgrowth
Certain medications (phenytoin, calcium channel blockers, etc.) can stimulate excessive gum tissue growth, leading to inflammation.

5. Hormonal Gingivitis
This type occurs during pregnancy, puberty, or steroid therapy due to hormonal changes, which increase gum sensitivity and inflammation.
HAVE YOU HEARD OF MENSTRUATION GINGIVITIS?

Have you heard of menstruation gingivitis?
Hormonal changes can contribute to gingivitis, especially in women. During puberty, menopause, menstrual cycles, and pregnancy, hormonal surges increase blood flow to the gums, making them more sensitive and reactive to irritation.

CAUSES OF GINGIVITIS
Causes Of Gingivitis

The primary cause of gingivitis is poor oral hygiene, which allows plaque to accumulate on the teeth and leads to swelling of the surrounding gum tissues. Here’s how plaque contributes to gingivitis:
Plaque formation:Plaque is a colorless, sticky film made mainly of bacteria that forms on your teeth after consuming starchy and sugary foods. It develops quickly and needs to be removed daily.

Tartar development:If plaque is not removed, it hardens into tartar (calculus) below the gumline. Tartar collects bacteria, makes plaque harder to remove, and irritates the gums. Professional dental cleaning is necessary to eliminate tartar.

Gum irritation:Prolonged presence of plaque and tartar irritates the gingiva (the gum tissue around the teeth), causing swelling and increased bleeding—this condition is known as gingivitis. If left untreated, gingivitis can lead to tooth decay, periodontitis, and ultimately tooth loss.
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN- PLAQUE AND TARTAR

Know the difference between- Plaque and Tartar
Plaque is a sticky film of bacteria that forms on teeth daily. If not removed, it hardens into tartar, a yellowish deposit that can only be removed by a dentist. Regular brushing and flossing help prevent plaque buildup and subsequent tartar formation.

Gingivitis is the early stage of gum disease, characterized by swollen, red, and possibly bleeding gums. If left untreated, it can progress into periodontitis, where the gums pull away from the teeth, causing them to become loose and potentially leading to tooth loss.

Around 48 % of adults over age 30 have some form of periodontal disease.

DIAGNOSIS OF GINGIVITIS
Diagnosis Of Gingivitis

The diagnosis of gingivitis involves a comprehensive assessment by a dental professional. Dentists typically use a combination of clinical examinations, patient history, and, in some cases, diagnostic tests to determine the presence and severity of gingivitis. Here are the key components of the diagnosis:

I. CLINICAL EXAMINATION
I. Clinical Examination
The diagnosis of gingivitis involves a thorough evaluation by a dental professional, combining clinical examinations, patient history, and sometimes diagnostic tests to assess the presence and severity of the condition. Key components include:
1. Physical examination:Dentists inspect the gums and surrounding tissues for redness, swelling, bleeding, and changes in appearance.


2. Patient history:Information about oral hygiene habits, medical history, and lifestyle factors helps identify potential risk factors.


3. Probing of gums:A periodontal probe measures the depth of spaces between teeth and gums. Increased depth indicates gum disease.


4. Bleeding on probing (BOP):Bleeding during gentle probing is a common sign of gingivitis and an important indicator of inflammation.


5. Gingival index:This standardized method quantifies the degree of gingival inflammation on a scale, with higher scores indicating more severe inflammation.

II. IMAGING TESTS
II. Imaging tests

1. Dental X-rays:In some cases, X-rays may be taken to assess the health of the bone supporting the teeth and to detect any signs of advanced gum disease or periodontitis.


2. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans:It is used to visualize the internal structures of the teeth and jawbone and assess the presence of cavities, bone loss, impacted teeth, and other dental conditions.


Regular dental check-ups are essential for early detection and prompt intervention, emphasizing the importance of preventive care and maintaining optimal oral health.
