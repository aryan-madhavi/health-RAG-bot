WARTS
Warts
OVERVIEW
Overview
Warts are small, grainy, noncancerous skin growths caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). The virus can be transmitted through direct and indirect contact, such as touching contaminated skin or articles. Transmission is fast through disrupted and soft skin.

The main characteristic symptom is the appearance of lesions that appear as skin growth with an irregular surface. In some cases, these lesions may itch, ache, and bleed. Individuals with a weakened immune system and children between the ages of 12 and 17 are more susceptible to this infection.

Almost two-thirds of wart cases resolve themselves. Treatment options include topical medications and some in-clinic therapies, such as cantharidin, cryosurgery, curettage, excision, photodynamic therapy, and laser treatment.

SYMPTOMS OF WARTS
Symptoms Of Warts

Warts are lesions/bumps in the skin and the thin skin that covers the inside surface of parts of the body, such as the nose and mouth.

Warts have a very long incubation period (the period from virus exposure to the onset of symptoms). It generally ranges from 1 to 6 months but can even take up to 12 months.

These lesions appear as skin growth with an irregular surface. Their size can range from 1 mm to several cm.

The other general signs and symptoms of warts include:The presence of small and rough bumps on skinAppearance of long threads or thin fingers on the skinThe presence of black dots that appear like seedsMild bleeding from bumpsItchingTightness or feeling of pressure


The lesions can appear alone (solitary) or in groups (mosaic). The most common sites of these warts are hands and feet. However, they occur in other body parts, depending on the type.

The characteristic of these lesions depends upon the type of the warts and include:
1. COMMON WARTS (VURRUCA VULGARIS)
1. Common warts (vurruca vulgaris)
Dome shaped nodules
Mainly located on fingers, hands, knees, elbows, or any other sites of trauma
It can also appear as thin and long outgrowths around the eyelids and lips
2. GENITAL WARTS

2. Genital warts
Small bumps in and around the genital area
Cause burning sensation and itching/irritation in the genital area

Nail biters commonly suffer from a different type of warts known as periungual warts. These warts develop around the fingers and can cause discomfort or pain and may disrupt nail growth.
CAUSES OF WARTS
Causes Of Warts

Warts are caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Although HPV has over 100 subtypes, only a few cause skin warts.
Warts can be transmitted easily through direct or indirect contact. The transmission of the virus is fast through disrupted and soft skin.
The mode of transmission includes:
Touching the skin of the infected person
Doing unprotected sexual intercourse
Touching contaminated objects such as towels and razor
Using communal bathrooms and swimming pools
Sharing sex toys
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE EXPOSURE?

What happens after the exposure?
Once HPV has infected the skin, it spreads to other parts through scratching, shaving, or injuries. The virus can enter the skin and multiply in its uppermost layer. It makes the outer layer of the skin thick and complex, and it protrudes as a wart.

A few subtypes of HPV have the potential to induce cancer. These strains include type 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, and 35. Individuals who are immunocompromised are more prone to transformation of warts into cancer.
RISK FACTORS FOR WARTS
Risk Factors For Warts

People in close contact with someone with warts are likely to develop warts. The other possible risk factors include:


1. WEAKENED IMMUNE SYSTEM
1. Weakened immune system
Individuals with low immunity cannot fight the virus effectively. This makes them more susceptible to viral infection, including warts. It also includes people who have undergone organ transplantation or have medical conditions such as cancer orHIV infection.

2. AGE
2. Age
Children and teenagers are at high risk of catching warts. The incidence of warts peaks between the ages of 12 and 16.
3. RACE

3. Race
White people are more likely to develop warts as compared to Blacks or Asians. Focal epithelial hyperplasia is more commonly observed in Inuit and American Indians.
4. MEDICAL CONDITIONS

4. Medical conditions
Several skin diseases, such aseczemaand dermatitis, increase the risk of warts.
5. OCCUPATION

5. Occupation
Frequent meat handlers are more exposed to HPV infection and, thus, more likely to develop warts. People who bite their nails or pick at hangnails also have an increased chance of developing warts.
6. UNPROTECTED SEXUAL INTERCOURSE

6. Unprotected sexual intercourse
Having unprotected oral, anal, or vaginal sex with an infected partner increases the risk of genital warts.
7. SMOKING

7. Smoking
Some studies suggest that smoking is associated with an increased risk of contracting genital warts.

DIAGNOSIS OF WARTS
Diagnosis Of Warts

The diagnosis of warts include:
1. CLINICAL EXAMINATION
1. Clinical examination
Each type of wart has a characteristic feature and location.  Almost all cases of warts are diagnosed through physical examination by a trained clinician.
2. DERMOSCOPY
2. Dermoscopy
It refers to the examination of skin using a high quality magnifying lens and a powerful lighting system (a dermatoscope). It reveals abnormalities of the skin.
3. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL (IHC) DETECTION
3. Immunohistochemical (IHC) detection
It uses antibodies to detect the location of proteins and other antigens in a sample of skin tissue. It confirms the presence of virus in a lesion.
4. SOUTHERN BLOT HYBRIDIZATION
4. Southern blot hybridization
It is used to identify the specific HPV type present in tissue. It has higher sensitivity than IHC.
5. POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION
5. Polymerase chain reaction
It is another confirmatory method to detect the virus present in a lesion. In this, the genetic material of the virus is amplified.
6. BIOPSY
6. Biopsy
In case of a suspicion of cancer, a sample of skin tissue is taken for biopsy.
PREVENTION OF WARTS
Prevention Of Warts


It is not possible to completely prevent warts as the virus is highly contagious. However, the following measures minimize the chances of infection to some extent.
1. VACCINATE YOURSELF
1. Vaccinate yourself
HPV vaccines protect against anal and genital warts to a greater extent. All people ages 9 to 45 can get the HPV vaccine to protect against genital warts and different types of cancer-causing HPV. Optimal protection starts early. That's why it's advisable to get the HPV vaccine sooner rather than later.

What is the schedule?A 2-dose schedule is recommended for people who get the first dose before their 15th birthday.In a 2-dose series, the second dose should be given 6–12 months after the first dose (0, 6–12-month schedule)A 3-dose schedule is recommended for people who get the first dose on or after their 15th birthday and those with certain immunocompromising conditions.


2. ENSURE FOOT CARE
2. Ensure foot care
Plantar warts can be prevented by maintaining a good foot hygiene routine. The following measures can help you achieve it:Wash your feet daily with soap and water.Dry them thoroughly, especially between the toes.Wear clean, dry, moisture-wicking socks. Change them regularly.Prefer open footwear like floaters that allow the skin to breathe.Regularly rotate shoes to air them out.Use shower sandals on wet locker room floors and public showers.Avoid used instruments such as pumice stones or nail files

3. TAKE PROPER CARE OF THE WOUNDS
3. Take proper care of the wounds
Wounds are the leading cause of infection. Proper care of wounds and injuries can help prevent viral infections. The following measures should be taken to keep the wounds away from the virus:Wash hands with soap and water more frequentlyUse an alcohol-based hand rub if washing is not possibleKeep the draining or open wounds cleanKeep the wounds and injuries covered with the dressings until they healAvoid hot tubs, swimming pools, and other water bodies such as lakes, rivers, and oceans till the wound heals completely.
