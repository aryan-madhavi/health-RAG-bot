HANGOVER
HangoverAlso known as After-effect, Drunkenness, and Veisalgia
OVERVIEW
Overview
A hangover is a collection of symptoms that occur after drinking too much alcohol.

Hangovers typically last around 24 hours. They can cause symptoms such as headaches, body pain, stomach problems, and reduced memory and concentration.

The intensity and duration of a hangover depend on the type and the amount of alcohol consumed. Mixing alcohol and caffeine, smoking, stress, and consuming alcohol without eating can increase the chances of a hangover, amongst other factors.

To prevent hangovers, it is recommended to stay hydrated, avoid mixing different types of alcohol, consume alcohol in moderation, and eat before consuming alcohol. Hangover symptoms typically go away within 8 to 24 hours, but in some cases, medications like antacids or NSAIDs may be recommended.
