MELANOMA
MelanomaAlso known as Malignant melanoma, Melanoblastoma, Melanocarcinoma, Melanoepithelioma, Melanosarcoma, Melanoscirrhus, Melanotic carcinoma and Nevus pigmentosa
OVERVIEW
Overview
Melanoma is a cancer of the cells which give color to skin, called the melanocytes. It can be more threatening than the other forms of skin cancer because it tends to metastasize or spread to other parts of the body, causing serious complications.

Risk factors for melanoma include fair skin, light hair and light-colored eyes, a history of prolonged and fierce sun exposure, close family members with melanoma, and moles that are irregular and large in size and number.

Early detection and diagnosis of melanoma are crucial. Changing or unusual spots on the skin should be brought to medical attention without delay. Diagnosis is usually done by a biopsy in which a piece of skin containing the pigmented tumor is removed for lab analysis.

Caught early, most melanomas can be managed with relatively minor surgical removal. However, treatment at the later stages becomes challenging and mostly comprises surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy.

SYMPTOMS OF MELANOMA
Symptoms Of Melanoma

Melanoma can develop anywhere on the body but is most common in sun-exposed areas like the face, arms, legs, and back. In darker skin tones, it may appear in less exposed areas such as the palms, soles, or nail beds, known as hidden melanomas. Some of the earliest symptoms of melanoma can be:
A change or development in a pre-existing mole
A new mole, pigmented skin, or growth starts developing on your skin

However, it is important to note that melanoma doesn’t always start from a mole. There are some easy ways to differentiate between a normal mole and a mole that can become cancerous.

To remember this, all you need to think of are the letters ABCDE:
‘A’ stands for asymmetry:A potentially cancerous mole is often asymmetrical, with uneven halves and an irregular shape.
‘B’ stands for border:In a cancerous mole, the border will be irregular. It will not be circular or oval, like normal moles. Instead, it might have a notched or scalloped border.
‘C’ stands for color:Carcinogenic (cancerous) moles may show uneven or changing colors, so watch for unusual growths with irregular color patterns.
‘D’ stands for diameter:Usually, moles are about ¼ inch or 6 millimeters. Anything larger than that can be carcinogenic.
‘E’ stands for evolving:The most significant indicator of a cancerous mole is that it changes over time. Try to see if the mole grows in size or changes its color. It might even change its shape or become itchy. In some cases, one might even note bleeding.

TYPES OF MELANOMA
Types Of Melanoma

Melanoma can be classified into the following types:
1. CUTANEOUS (SKIN) MELANOMA
1. Cutaneous (skin) melanoma
There are four major types of cutaneous melanoma:


Superficial spreading melanoma:This is the most common form of the disease, responsible for about 70% of cases. This type usually develops in a pre-existing mole.


Nodular melanoma:This is the second most common, responsible for 15 to 30% of cases. These are more aggressive and usually develop more rapidly than superficial melanomas.


Lentigo maligna:This type of melanoma appears as large, flat lesions most commonly found on the faces of light-skinned women over the age of 50. This form of melanoma, responsible for about 4% to 10% of cases, has a lower risk of metastasis than other types.


Acral lentiginous melanoma:This occurs on the palms, soles of the feet or beneath the nail beds. They account for only 2% to 8% of melanomas in fair-skinned patients, but up to 60% of melanomas in darker-skinned patients. This type of melanoma is extremely aggressive and large, with an average diameter of three centimeters.
2. MUCOSAL MELANOMA
2. Mucosal melanomaMucosal melanomas are rare, making up only about 1% of all diagnosed melanoma cases.This disease occurs in mucosal tissue, which lines body cavities and hollow organs like the nasal cavity, mouth and esophagus, rectum, urinary tract and vagina.
3. OCULAR MELANOMA
3. Ocular melanoma
Because the eyes contain melanocytes, or pigment-producing cells, they can be susceptible to melanoma. Two types of ocular melanoma include:
Uveal melanoma:It is an eye cancer that affects the iris (the colored part of the eye), the ciliary body (helps focus and produces eye fluid), or the choroid (provides oxygen and nutrients to the eye).
Conjunctival melanoma:This is the melanoma of the conjunctiva that presents as a raised, pigmented or non-pigmented lesion that appears in adult life.
CAUSES OF MELANOMA
Causes Of Melanoma

Melanoma happens when melanocytes, the cells that produce skin color, become damaged. It usually starts in moles, but most moles aren't cancerous.

Normally, old skin cells are shed, but DNA damage can cause cells to multiply abnormally, forming cancerous clusters.
The cancerous moles can be a result of DNA mutations. DNA mutations can cause different types of cancers.

The gene mutations resulting in melanoma can be of two types:
1. ACQUIRED GENE MUTATIONS
1. Acquired gene mutations
Melanoma is typically caused by gene mutations acquired during life, not inherited.
These mutations can happen randomly or be triggered by external factors like UV exposure.
UV rays from the sun or tanning beds damage skin cells and can lead to melanoma over time.
Melanoma is more common in adults due to long-term UV exposure, but can also occur in areas not exposed to the sun, often due to genetic changes.
2. INHERITED GENE MUTATIONS
2. Inherited gene mutationsPeople can also inherit the gene changes that are responsible for melanoma from their parents. However, this is a rare scenario.These people have specific DNAs that are more likely to develop melanomas, especially in regions exposed to the sun.Did you know?

RISK FACTORS FOR MELANOMA
Risk Factors For Melanoma

There are several risk factors for melanoma. Some of these include:
1. DYSPLASTIC MOLES
1. Dysplastic moles
A dysplastic nevus is a type of mole that looks different from a common mole (nevi).
The risk of melanoma is greatest for people who have a large number of dysplastic nevi.
2. FAIR SKIN
2. Fair skinMelanoma occurs more frequently in people who have fair skin that burns or freckles easily (these people also usually have red or blond hair and blue eyes) than in people with dark skin.
3. ETHNICITY
3. EthnicityCaucasians tend to get melanoma far more often than black people, probably because light skin is more easily damaged by the sun.
4. PERSONAL OR FAMILY HISTORY OF MELANOMA OR OTHER SKIN CANCERS
4. Personal or family history of melanoma or other skin cancers
People who have been treated for melanoma have a high risk of a second melanoma. Melanoma sometimes runs in families.
Having two or more close relatives who have had this disease is a risk factor.
5. ATYPICAL MOLE SYNDROME (FORMERLY TERMED B-K MOLE SYNDROME, DYSPLASTIC NEVUS SYNDROME)
5. Atypical mole syndrome (formerly termed B-K mole syndrome, dysplastic nevus syndrome)
This inherited condition causes the growth of many unusual moles.
If a close relative has had melanoma, it is known as familial atypical multiple mole and melanoma syndrome (FAMMM).
6. AGE
6. Age
Melanoma is more common in older people, with a median age of diagnosis around 50, but it can also affect younger individuals, especially those with a family history.
7. ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
7. Environmental factors
Ultraviolet (UV) radiation
Indoor tanning
Severe, blistering sunburns

8. WEAKENED IMMUNE SYSTEM
8. Weakened immune system
People whose immune system is weakened by certain cancers, by drugs given following organ transplantation, or by HIV are at increased risk of developing melanoma.

9. OTHER INHERITED CONDITIONS
9. Other inherited conditions
Xeroderma Pigmentosum
Retinoblastoma
Li-Fraumeni Syndrome
Werner Syndrome
Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer SyndromesDid you know?
Lower socioeconomic status has been linked to more advanced cases of melanoma at the time of detection. This could be because individuals with low socioeconomic status have less risk perception and knowledge of the disease.
DIAGNOSIS OF MELANOMA
Diagnosis Of Melanoma

Several tests and procedures can be conducted to diagnose melanoma. Some of the standard tests include:
1. PHYSICAL EXAM
1. Physical exam
The doctor will first ask you various questions about your medical and health history. After that, they will inspect your skin to find any symptoms or signs that might indicate melanoma.
2. BIOPSY
2. BiopsyShave (tangential) biopsy:A shave biopsy is useful in diagnosing many types of skin diseases and in sampling moles when the risk of melanoma is very low.

Punch biopsy:The doctor rotates the punch biopsy tool on the skin until it cuts through all the layers of the skin. The sample is removed and the edges of the biopsy site are often stitched together.

Excisional biopsy:This is done to examine a tumor that might have grown into deeper layers of the skin.

Incisional biopsy:An incisional biopsy removes only a portion of the tumor.
3. BIOPSIES OF MELANOMA THAT MAY HAVE METASTASIZED (SPREAD)

3. Biopsies of melanoma that may have metastasized (spread)
Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC):It may be used to biopsy large lymph nodes near a melanoma to find out if the melanoma has spread to them.
Surgical (excisional) lymph node biopsy:This procedure can be used to remove an enlarged lymph node through a small incision (cut) in the skin.
Sentinel lymph node biopsy:If melanoma has been diagnosed and has any concerning features (such as being at least a certain thickness), a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is often done to see if the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes.
4. IMAGING TESTS
4. Imaging tests
Chest x-ray:This test might be done to help determine if melanoma has spread to the lungs.
Ultrasound:It uses sound waves to create images of the inside of your body on a computer screen.
Ultrasound-guided needle biopsy:It helps assess melanoma by creating detailed images of nearby lymph nodes or tissues to check for cancer spread.
Computed tomography (CT) scan:It helps detect melanoma spread to internal organs or lymph nodes with detailed cross-sectional images.
CT-guided needle biopsy:CT scans can also be used to help guide a biopsy needle into a suspicious area within the body.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan:MRI scans use radio waves and strong magnets instead and can be very helpful in looking at any tumor in the brain and spinal cord.
Positron emission tomography (PET) scan:A PET scan can help show if the cancer has spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body. It is most useful in people with more advanced stages of melanoma.
PET/CT scan:This lets the doctor compare areas of higher radioactivity on the PET scan with the more detailed appearance of that area on the CT scan.
5. BLOOD TESTS
5. Blood tests
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
Complete blood count (CBC)
Liver function tests (LFT)
Kidney function tests (KFT)

Make sure to get the right diagnosis with reliable medical tests.

TREATMENT OF MELANOMA
Treatment Of Melanoma

In its early stages, the easiest way to treat melanoma is through surgery. However, when melanoma spreads beyond the skin, several different methods might get used for treatment in its later stages.
1. REMOVAL OF LYMPH NODES
1. Removal of lymph nodes
It is a surgical method used if the melanoma has spread beyond the skin to the lymph nodes. The doctor will remove the affected lymph nodes and a small part of the surrounding area to stop the spread.
2. IMMUNOTHERAPY
2. Immunotherapy
It is a drug treatment that is commonly recommended after surgery. There are two major types of drugs that are used in immunotherapy.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors:These drugs enable the proteins in the immune system, which are disabled by the cancerous cells. Therefore, the immune system again starts attacking the cancer cells. Some common drugs include:
Nivolumab
Pembrolizumab
Ipilimumab

Cytokines:The body produces proteins called cytokines which help in boosting the immune system. In some cases, doctors recommend artificial cytokines for melanoma. These drugs make it difficult for cancer cells to divide and multiply.
Some common drugs include:
Interferon Alpha 2A
Interferon Alpha 2B
Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2B
Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2A
3. TARGETED THERAPY
3. Targeted therapy
In targeted therapies, drugs are aimed at a distinct point in the cancer cells responsible for multiplying and dividing abnormally. This therapy is unique to every patient, depending on how their cancer cells react to the drug.
4. CHEMOTHERAPY
4. Chemotherapy
These are drugs that kill cancer cells. Some common chemotherapy drugs include:
Carboplatin
Abraxane

COMPLICATIONS OF MELANOMA
Complications of Melanoma

Some common complications of melanoma are:
Recurrence:Cancer always has a chance of recurring in your lifetime, even after it has been completely removed. It is best to check yourself regularly, even when the treatment is complete.
Metastasis:In this scenario, cancer can spread beyond the skin to the muscles, organs, and nerves of the body.
Secondary infection:This is seen due to disruption of the normal skin barrier.
Scarring:Can result from the lesion itself or treatments.
Lymphedema:It refers to tissue swelling caused by an accumulation of protein-rich fluid systems. It commonly occurs secondary to the removal of lymph nodes but can result from cancer alone.
Depressionandanxiety:A higher prevalence of anxiety and depression have been identified in patients with advanced melanoma compared to those with early disease.
