PRE-ECLAMPSIA
Pre-eclampsiaEarlier known as Toxemia of pregnancy, and Toxaemia
OVERVIEW
Overview
Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy complication in which the mother develops high blood pressure (hypertension) and excessive protein in the urine (proteinuria).
This condition typically develops after the 20th week of pregnancy.

Many women with pre-eclampsia do not have any symptoms. Some of the first signs of pre-eclampsia are high blood pressure, protein in the urine, and sudden swelling of the faces, hands and feet.

The exact cause of pre-eclampsia isn't fully understood, but it's thought to be associated with placental issues and risk factors like advanced maternal age, prior history of the condition, multiple pregnancies (e.g., twins), and certain health conditions.

For those at risk, steps like gaining a healthy amount of weight, managing blood pressure and blood sugar levels, along with low dose aspirin can help reduce the chances of pre-eclampsia during pregnancy.

The cure for pre-eclampsia is delivery of the baby. If the baby is not close to term, the mother will be monitored regularly. Bed rest at home or hospital will be advised depending on the severity of pre-eclampsia. Medications to manage hypertension, prevent seizures and promote the baby’s lung maturity will be administered.

Most women who develop pre-eclampsia deliver healthy babies and do not have any further complications. However, in some cases, complications can occur which can be potentially fatal to the mother or baby.

CAUSES OF PRE-ECLAMPSIA
Causes Of Pre-eclampsia

Although the exact cause of pre-eclampsia is not known, it is believed to occur when there's a problem with the placenta, the specialized organ that develops inside the womb to give the baby the food and oxygen it needs to grow.
Compromised blood supply to the placenta in the case of pre-eclampsia, can lead to problems in the mother and the fetus. Many risk factors associated with the same are discussed in the next section.

DIAGNOSIS OF PRE-ECLAMPSIA
Diagnosis Of Pre-eclampsia

The diagnosis of preeclampsia is crucial as it may not present with any symptoms at first. It include's
1. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND MEDICAL HISTORY
1. Physical examination and medical history
Physical examination helps identify signs and symptoms of preeclampsia, such as high blood pressure (more than 140/90 mmHg), and swelling. Medical history is taken to assess risk factors, augment diagnosis and form treatment decisions.
2.URINE ANALYSIS
2.Urine analysis
This is done to check proteins in the urine. It can easily be tested for protein using a dipstick (it is a strip of paper that's been treated with chemicals so it reacts to protein, usually by changing color). If a concentration of protein is present in urine it is sent for further testing.
3. BLOOD TESTS
3. Blood tests
Placental growth factor (PIGF): This is a gold standard test in the prediction, diagnosis, and treatment of preeclampsia. It assesses the severity of the condition by measuring the levels of this specific protein in the blood.
Circulating soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1: This test measures the levels of this protein tyrosine kinase, which can be elevated in this condition.
Kidney Function tests (KFT):This test is done to assess the kidneys as preeclampsia can be due to kidney disease. Assessment is also done to check for any damage to the kidneys.
Liver Function tests (LFT):Liver abnormalities occur in 3% of pregnancies, and preeclampsia is the most frequent cause.
Blood platelet: Thrombocytopenia (a condition that occurs when the platelet count in the blood is too low) is the most common hematological abnormality observed in preeclampsia. This test is done to check whether blood clotting is taking place properly or not.

4. IMAGING TESTS
4. Imaging tests
Fetal ultrasound:While it is not a direct method for diagnosing preeclampsia in the mother, it can provide valuable information about the baby's health and development.
Nonstress tests (NST): These tests involve monitoring the baby's heart rate in response to its own movements. They can help determine if the baby is under stress due to potential complications arising from the mother's condition.
Cardiotocography: It is a monitoring method that records the baby's heart rate and the mother's uterine contractions. In preeclampsia, CTG can be useful for assessing fetal well-being.

PREVENTION OF PRE-ECLAMPSIA
Prevention Of Pre-eclampsia

Though preeclampsia cannot be prevented in all cases, some steps can be taken to reduce the risk of developing preeclampsia. These include:
Maintain blood sugar and blood pressure levels in the right range
During pregnancy, the target range for blood sugar levels is typically 60-99 mg/dL before meals and 100-129 mg/dL after meals. Blood pressure should ideally be around 120/80 mm Hg. However, specific targets may vary.

ENGAGE IN REGULAR EXERCISE

Engage in regular exercise
Mild physical exercises during pregnancy, including swimming, walking, yoga, and mild stretching, improves blood flow to tissues and organs and maintains cardiac health.
Note: It is important to evaluate risk v/s benefits of exercise for the prevention of preeclampsia with your doctor.
MANAGE STRESS EFFICIENTLY
Manage stress efficiently
Several studies emphasize the role of stress in the development of preeclampsia. You can try practicing yoga, meditation, listening to soft music, spending time in nature, and deep breathing exercises to manage stress.
MEDICATION
Medication
If you have one high-risk factor or more than one moderate-risk factor for preeclampsia, the use of low-dose aspirin is usually advised after 12 weeks of pregnancy. Consult your doctor before taking any medications to make sure it's safe for you and your baby.Did you know?

TREATMENT OF PRE-ECLAMPSIA
Treatment Of Pre-eclampsia

The cure for preeclampsia is giving birth. The doctor will assess when to deliver based on how far is the mother due, and the severity of preeclampsia.
If the baby is close to full term (37 weeks pregnant or more), the doctor may advise to induce labor or do a cesarean section.
If the baby is not close to term, the mother will be monitored closely and regularly for the following :
Blood pressure
Level of protein in the urine
Blood check-ups- including liver or kidney function tests
Baby’s heart rate
Ultrasound scans to check blood flow through the placenta, growth of the baby, amount of amniotic fluid amongst other factors.

The idea is to prolong the pregnancy and allow the baby to grow and develop. The closer the birth is to the due date, the better it is for the baby.
The following will be advised to manage preeclampsia and its potential complications:
Bed rest, either at home or in the hospital, depending on the severity of preeclampsia. It is advised to sleep or lie down mostly on the left side.
MEDICATIONS TO LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE: SOME EXAMPLES INCLUDE:
Medications to lower blood pressure: Some examples include:
Labetalol
Nifedipine
Hydralazine

MEDICATIONS TO PROMOTE THE BABY'S LUNG MATURITY: STEROIDS LIKE:
Medications to promote the baby's lung maturity: Steroids like:
Betamethasone
Dexamethasone

MEDICATIONS TO PREVENT ECLAMPSIA-RELATED SEIZURES:
Medications to prevent eclampsia-related seizures:
I.V. Magnesium



POST-DELIVERY MANAGEMENT
Post-delivery management

Preeclampsia usually improves soon after the baby is born, but a few complications can sometimes develop a few days later.

The mother’s blood pressure should be monitored carefully and medicines should be administered carefully.

The baby that is born prematurely will be kept and monitored in the neonatal intensive care unit.

The mother should have her blood pressure checked regularly after leaving the hospital, and she may need to continue taking medicine to lower her blood pressure for several weeks.

COMPLICATIONS OF PRE-ECLAMPSIA
Complications Of Pre-eclampsia

Many cases of pre-eclampsia do not pose serious problems and improve soon after the delivery of the baby. However, in some cases, if it is not diagnosed and treated timely, it can pose serious complications to both the mother and the baby.
COMPLICATIONS AFFECTING THE MOTHER
Complications affecting the mother
HELLP syndrome:HELLP is an acronym that stands for
Hemolysis (premature red blood cell breakdown)
Elevated liver enzyme levels
Lowplatelets (cells involved in blood clotting)

Stroke: The blood supply to the brain can be disrupted as a result of high blood pressure leading to a stroke.

Fits (eclampsia): In rare cases, eclampsia, a type of seizures or coma fit might develop. During the fit, the mother's arms, legs, neck, or jaw will twitch involuntarily in repetitive movements.

Organ problems:
Kidney failure
Liver failure
Heart attackand cardiovascular issues
Acute respiratory distress
Blood clotting disorder
Eye complications
