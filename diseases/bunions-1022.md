BUNIONS
BunionsAlso known as hallux valgus
OVERVIEW
Overview
A bunion refers to a bump-like structure on the side of the big toe. Over some time, the big toe starts leaning towards the second toe.

People with high heels, narrow and tight shoes, and hard soles are more prone to develop bunions. Other risk factors include a positive family history, foot problems, obesity, and arthritis.

Bunions can cause pain and rotation of the big toe, making walking and wearing certain footwear challenging. However, the condition can be effectively managed through lifestyle changes. By avoiding high heels, pointed shoes, and incorporating specific exercises like toe curls, you can take control of your foot health and manage bunions.

If these are ineffective, surgical management is recommended. Patients typically tolerate the surgery well.

CAUSES OF BUNION
Causes Of Bunion

Each foot has five bones, known as metatarsal bones, numbered one to five from the hallux (great toe) to the small toe. These bones are connected to the bones of the toes, known as phalanges, through metatarsophalangeal joints (MTP). Numerous bands of tissues and muscles help hold bones and  joints in place.
The exact cause of bunion is unclear, but it is thought to occur due to a complex interplay of the following factors:
Imbalance of the muscles of the foot can cause slight misalignment of the toe
Increased pressure at the first MTP joint
The muscle imbalance and increased pressure at the MTP joint push the greater toe towards the second toe. This increased tension also increases the hallux angle—the angle created between the phalanx (toe bone) and the first metatarsal. These forces strain the ligaments, eventually causing them to rupture.
These changes are seen as a “bump” at the base of the big toe. Due to increased pressure at the MTP joint, the deformity worsens as the individual walks.
SYMPTOMS OF BUNION
Symptoms Of Bunion

A bunion is a disorder of the great toe in which it is moved towards the second toe. The onset of this deformity is generally chronic. The signs and symptoms include:
Bump at the joint of the base of the big toe
Rotation of the toe
Bulging of the head of the big toe
Burning or tingling pain at the metatarsophalangeal joint (joint that joins bones of the foot to the toe)
Thickening of the skin at the base of the big toe
Toe tenderness
Limitation in walking
Difficulty in wearing shoes
The pain's frequency, duration, and severity increase as the disease progresses.


Interesting fact!
Bunion is derived from the Latin word "bunion," which refers to enlargement.
TYPES OF BUNION
Types Of Bunion

LARGE BUNION
Large bunion
This involves the presence of a large protruding mass near the big toe joint, which eventually turns the big toe towards the second toe.

TAILOR'S BUNION (BUNIONETTE)
Tailor's bunion (bunionette)
This type of bunion affects the smallest toe. Although this type of bunion is less common, it can be red and painful, especially if it rubs against your shoes.

ADOLESCENT BUNION
Adolescent bunion
Adolescent bunions are bunions that occur in young people. They are most common in girls between the ages of 10 and 15. Adolescent bunions generally do not limit motion but are mostly painful.
It is advised to delay the surgery of such a bunion until skeletal maturity.
RISK FACTORS FOR BUNION
Risk Factors For Bunion

The following risk factors can trigger the formation of bunions:
1. FAMILY HISTORY
1. Family history
Individuals with a family history of foot problems are more likely to develop bunions.
2. FOOT PROBLEMS
2. Foot problems
Individuals with specific foot problems are more likely to develop bunions. The deformities that increase the chances of foot problems are:
Flat foot (a condition in which the arches on the inside of the feet flatten when pressure is put on them)
Abnormal and excessive mobility of the first toe
Excessive foot pronation (rolling of the foot towards the inner side while walking)
3. GENDER
3. Gender
Women are more prone to developing bunions, mainly due to the use of high heels.

High heels can cause pain in your heels, back, and knees. Here are five habits of women that can be harmful to them.

5. CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDERS
5. Connective tissue disorders
Connective tissue disorders cause inflammation of the tissues, which may weaken the support of the joint, predisposing the individual to develop bunions. The connective tissue disorders that can cause bunions include Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, andDown syndrome.
6. MUSCLE IMBALANCE AND POSTURAL DYSFUNCTION
6. Muscle imbalance and postural dysfunction
Disturbed muscle balance and postural dysfunction due to certain medical conditions, such asstrokeand cerebral palsy, may lead to the development of bunions. This is because the limited range of motion of the big toes causes bony protrusions.
7. TYPES OF SHOES
7. Types of shoes

DIAGNOSIS OF BUNION
Diagnosis Of Bunion

The doctor gets a thorough medical history along with the knowledge of symptoms. The following steps aid in the diagnosis of bunion:

1. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
1. Physical examination
In most cases, bunions can be easily diagnosed through physical examination of the foot. Doctors also move the toe gently to determine whether pain occurs during motion.


2. X-RAYS
2. X-rays
It provides images of dense structures such as bone. An X-ray helps to check:
Alignment of the toes
Damage to the MTP joint
Arthritis associated with bunion

3. ULTRASOUND
3. Ultrasound
It is recommended in severe cases where the person is experiencing numbness and tingling sensation in the feet. It helps to reveal the involvement of nerves.


4. MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI)
4. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
Any changes in the foot's structure may lead to other types of damage, such as fracture. This is diagnosed through an MRI scan, which can also reveal any inflammation in the nerves of the feet and toes.
PREVENTION OF BUNION
Prevention Of Bunion

1. CHOOSE THE RIGHT FOOTWEAR
1. Choose the right footwear
Choosing the proper footwear can easily prevent most cases of bunions. Before buying footwear, it is advised to check the following parameters:Comfort:The pair of shoes should provide instant comfort when the feet are slipped into the feet. There should be no pinching or rubbing-like feeling while wearing shoes.Size:Individuals should make sure that the footwear have proper length and width. Avoid choosing the size by marking, as it may vary according to the style and company.Support:The footwear, especially shoes with an arch support, minimizes the chances of a bunion.
2. REST YOUR FEET
2. Rest your feet
Proper rest is essential between physical activities that exert a lot of pressure on the feet. It is also advised to take off shoes for a few minutes at regular intervals, which gives your feet room to breathe.


3. HAVE YOUR FEET MEASURED REGULARLY
3. Have your feet measured regularly
The size of our feet changes as we age. Therefore, it is essential to measure the size of our feet regularly and change our footwear accordingly.
Measure the size of both feet. In most people, one foot is larger than the other. Fit shoes to the largest foot.


4. MAINTAIN A HEALTHY WEIGHT
4. Maintain a healthy weight

Surgery is often recommended if the individual has:
Persistent pain and difficulty walking even after a change in footwear and other nonsurgical procedures.
Chronic big toe inflammation
Drifting of the big toe towards the smaller toes
Inability to bend and straighten the big toe

The primary aim of the surgery is to reduce pain by adjusting the position of the big toe.
Several types of surgeries are available for bunions. The surgeries are performed based on the diagnosis made by X-ray and physical findings.
In most cases, a hospital stay is not required after bunion surgery. However, recovery may take several weeks.


IV. POST OPERATIVE CARE
IV. Post operative care
Postoperative care depends on the type of surgery performed. Right after surgery, individuals may be able to bear weight on the foot using a stiff-soled shoe. In some cases, individuals are advised to remain immobile for a short period. Most of the exercises are advised to start after the removal of sutures.
The following recovery tips help heal the wound faster and reduce pain.
Keep the dressings dry for at least two weeks
Massage the affected area after the removal of the bandage
Keep the feet elevated for the first few weeks to reduce pain
Apply ice packs on the foot for 30 minutes every 1-2 hours during the first few days
