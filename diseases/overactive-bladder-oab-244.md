OVERACTIVE BLADDER (OAB)
Overactive bladder (OAB)Also known as Urge incontinence
OVERVIEW
Overview
Overactive bladder (OAB) is a condition where the bladder’s muscles contract too often, causing a sudden, hard-to-control urge to urinate. Abnormal nerve signals and weak pelvic floor muscles can lead to OAB. OAB affects millions of adults worldwide. Despite being common, many people hesitate to seek help due to embarrassment.




Stress and excess caffeine or alcohol can also worsen symptoms. This can lead to frequent bathroom trips, nighttime urination (nocturia), and sometimes leakage before reaching the toilet (urge incontinence). It is common in older adults and females.


Pregnancy or childbirth, prostate enlargement in men, urinary tract infections, certain medications, chronic conditions likediabetes, and neurological disorders likeParkinson’s diseaseorstrokecan increase the likelihood of OAB.




Lifestyle changes, such as bladder training, fluid management, pelvic floor exercises, medications to relax the bladder, Botox injections, and nerve stimulation therapies, can help improve symptoms.

SYMPTOMS OF OVERACTIVE BLADDER
Symptoms Of Overactive Bladder

Overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms are marked by urinary urgency, often accompanied by other lower urinary tract symptoms. It occurs without infection or another obvious cause. These can include:


Sudden, strong urge to urinate that is difficult to controlUrge to urinate more often during the daytimeWaking up one or more times at night to urinate (nocturia)Unintentional urine leakage (urinary incontinence) associated with urgency.

CAUSES OF OVERACTIVE BLADDER
Causes Of Overactive Bladder

Your bladder acts like a storage tank that slowly fills with urine, and only when it’s full, your brain sends a signal that it’s time to go pee. The bladder muscle then squeezes, and the urine is released in a controlled way.

In an overactive bladder, this communication system doesn’t work smoothly. The bladder muscle (called the detrusor) sometimes contracts too early or too often, even when the bladder isn’t full.

The signals between the bladder and brain may get “mixed up,” making you feel a sudden and strong urge to urinate. In some people, the bladder becomes extra sensitive, so even a small amount of urine can trigger the urge to urinate.

Certain factors, like aging, nerve issues, bladder irritation, or other health conditions, can increase the chances of these bladder misfires. We will explore these risk factors in detail in the next section.


RISK FACTORS FOR OVERACTIVE BLADDER
Risk Factors For Overactive Bladder

Main risk factors for overactive bladder can include:

Age:Risk increases with advancing age due to weakening bladder muscles and changes in nerve control.

Gender:Women are at higher risk, especially aftermenopause, due to reduced estrogen levels. Men with prostate problems can also develop OAB.

Neurological conditions:Stroke,Parkinson’s disease,multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, or diabetic neuropathy can disrupt nerve signaling and lead to an overactive bladder.

Bladder outlet obstruction:Conditions likebenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)in men can increase the likelihood of OAB.

Recurrenturinary tract infections (UTIs):Can cause bladder irritation and contribute to an overactive bladder.

Obesity:Being overweight or obese can increase abdominal pressure, which can worsen urinary urgency and frequency.

Diabetes:Long-term high blood sugar can damage bladder nerves, leading to an overactive bladder.

Lifestyle factors:High caffeine intake, smoking, and excessive fluid intake may worsen symptoms.

Pregnancy and childbirth:Both can weaken pelvic floor muscles, stretch bladder-supporting tissues, and sometimes damage nerves, increasing the risk of OAB symptoms later in life.
Family history:Some studies suggest a hereditary component to developing an overactive bladder.

DIAGNOSIS OF OVERACTIVE BLADDER
Diagnosis Of Overactive Bladder

An overactive bladder is diagnosed based on symptoms. Clinical diagnosis begins with a detailed medical history and symptom discussion. It consists of the following:

1. MEDICAL HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
1. Medical history and physical examination

Doctors first ask about your symptoms (urgency, frequent trips to the toilet, leakage, nighttime urination) and lifestyle habits like fluid intake or caffeine use.
They also check for other health conditions (e.g., diabetes, neurological issues, prior surgeries) that may mimic or worsen OAB.

2. QUESTIONNAIRES AND BLADDER DIARIES
2. Questionnaires and bladder diaries

The person may be asked to fill in short surveys about how symptoms affect daily life.
A “bladder diary” of3–7 daysof record of fluid intake, toilet visits, and leakage episodes helps doctors see patterns and triggers.

3. URINE TESTS
3. Urine tests

Urine analysis:It can rule out infections, blood in urine, or other kidney/bladder issues.

Urine culture:It is done when an infection is suspected.

4. POST-VOID RESIDUAL (PVR)
4. Post-void residual (PVR)

An ultrasound may check if urine remains in the bladder after peeing.
This is done in select cases, especially if there’s difficulty emptying the bladder.

5. IMAGING AND ADVANCED TESTS
5. Imaging and advanced tests

Ultrasound (lower abdomen):Helps check the kidneys, bladder, and how well urine is being emptied.

Cystoscopy:This test allows the doctor to look inside the bladder with a tiny camera and check for any abnormalities or obstructions.

Urodynamic studies:These are special tests that measure how well the bladder stores and releases urine. Done only in cases where the treatment fails.

TREATMENT OF OVERACTIVE BLADDER
Treatment Of Overactive Bladder

Overactive bladder treatment or management starts with lifestyle and behavioural changes. It consists of bladder training, kegal exercises, reducing bladder irritants, etc. Other treatment options may include:

1.  MEDICATIONS
1.  Medications

Antimuscarinic agents:These work by blocking bladder contractions but may cause dry mouth (xerostomia) andconstipation. Commonly used drugs include:OxybutyninTolterodine



β3-adrenergic agonists:These relax the bladder with fewer side effects, especially useful for older adults or those sensitive to anticholinergic medications. Examples include:MirabegronVibegron

Combination therapies:Pairing antimuscarinics with β3 agonists can yield better symptom control with manageable side effects.

2. ADVANCED THERAPIES
2. Advanced therapies

Botox:Botox injections are given into the bladder muscle to reduce overactivity. Repeated treatment may be needed for better outcomes. OnabotulinumtoxinA is most commonly used.

Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS):This is a minimally invasive procedure that uses mild electrical stimulation near the ankle to reduce urgency.
Sacral neuromodulation:An implantable device is used that sends electrical pulses to nerves controlling bladder function. This is used in severe cases.


HOME-CARE FOR OVERACTIVE BLADDER
Home-care For Overactive Bladder

One of the most effective home strategies for OAB is Kegel exercises, which strengthen the pelvic floor muscles that support bladder control.

How to do the Kegel exercise right?

Simply tighten the muscles you use to stop urination, hold for 5 seconds, then relax for 5 seconds.
Repeat this10–15 times, 3 times a day.

Things to avoid with an overactive bladder

Bladder irritants:Cut down on caffeine, alcohol, carbonated drinks, artificial sweeteners, and spicy foods, as they can worsen urgency.

Excess fluid intake at once:Drinking large amounts quickly can overwhelm the bladder and spread it evenly throughout the day.

Late-night drinking:Avoid excess fluids2–3 hoursbefore bedtime to reduce nighttime trips.

Constipation triggers:Limit low-fiber foods like white bread, processed foods, red meat, etc, as constipation can worsen bladder symptoms.

Reduced quality of life:OAB significantly affects daily life, leading to sleep disruption, social withdrawal, anxiety, and evendepression.

Increased urinary tract infections (UTIs):Frequent bathroom visits and retained urine may contribute to bladder irritation and increase the likelihood of UTIs.

Risk of falls and fractures:Urgent nighttime trips to the toilet elevate the risk of falls, particularly among older adults, which can lead to injuries.

Economic and personal burden:Beyond personal discomfort, OAB contributes to sizable healthcare costs and lost productivity for both affected individuals and caregivers.


ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR OVERACTIVE BLADDER
Alternative Therapies For Overactive Bladder

Some alternative therapies can help individuals with an overactive bladder. But it is important to understand that these should not replace conventional treatments and always consult your doctor before trying them. Therapies that may help include:



ACUPUNCTURE
Acupuncture

Acupuncture is a traditional therapy that involves inserting very thin needles into specific points on the body to restore balance and relieve symptoms. Studies show that acupuncture can reduce bladder urgency and frequency.



PELVIC FLOOR ELECTRICAL STIMULATION (PFES)
Pelvic floor electrical stimulation (PFES)

In this therapy, gentle electrical pulses via vaginal or anal devices are given that can help strengthen pelvic floor muscles. This has shown good results, but more research is required in this field.
