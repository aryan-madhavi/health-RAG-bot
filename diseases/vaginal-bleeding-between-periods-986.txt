VAGINAL BLEEDING BETWEEN PERIODS
Vaginal bleeding between periods
OVERVIEW
Overview
Vaginal bleeding is normal and occurs during a woman's menstrual cycle when she gets her period. Normal cycle occurs between 24 and 34 days apart and it usually lasts for 4 to 7 days in most cases.

However, any bleeding outside of this is considered abnormal and can be caused by a range of factors including hormonal imbalance, any growth or infections in the uterus or cervix, stress, miscarriage, and certain medical conditions amongst other factors.

The signs of vaginal bleeding between periods include heavy periods (menorrhagia), bleeding between periods or after sex, and irregular or longer duration of periods.

Maintaining a healthy weight, reducing stress, indulging in light to moderate exercise and practicing safe sex can help prevent this condition in some cases.

Treatment may vary according to the cause of abnormal vaginal bleeding.

CAUSES OF VAGINAL BLEEDING BETWEEN PERIODS
Causes Of Vaginal Bleeding Between Periods

Bleeding between periods can be caused by an array of causes.
PALM-COEINis an acronym provided by the International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology (FIGO) to classify the underlying causes of abnormal uterine bleeding.
P:Polyp (small, abnormal growth)
A:Adenomyosis (a condition where the tissue lining the uterus grows into the uterus)
L:Leiomyoma (known as a fibroid, is a noncancerous growth of the uterus)
M:Malignancy (cancer) and hyperplasia (excessive tissue growth)
C:Coagulopathy (impaired blood clotting)
O:Ovulatory dysfunction (a condition where the ovaries do not release eggs regularly)
E:Endometrial disorders (medical conditions affecting the lining of the uterus)
I:Iatrogenic (health problems caused accidentally by medical treatment)
N:Not otherwise classified


A woman with one or more of these listed conditions can have abnormal vaginal bleeding. The various risk factors associated with these factors are described elaborately in the next section.
RISK FACTORS OF VAGINAL BLEEDING BETWEEN PERIODS
Risk Factors Of Vaginal Bleeding Between Periods
1. HORMONAL CHANGES

1. Hormonal changes
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS):It is a common cause of menstrual irregularities, including spotting between periods.
Hypothyroidism:An underactive thyroid gland can interrupt regular menstrual cycles and increase the risk of abnormal vaginal bleeding,
Hyperthyroidism:An overactive thyroid gland is a common risk factor for abnormal uterine bleeding among reproductive-age women.
Use of Oral Contraceptive Pills:The most common effect of taking oral contraceptive pills during the first few months of use is spotting or bleeding between periods (breakthrough bleeding).
Being underweight orObese:Weight affects the body's hormonal balance. Thus, being overweight or underweight or sudden changes in weight can trigger irregular bleeding.

Want to know the other health risks of obesity?
Enlighten yourself nowHormone Replacement Therapy (HRT):During the initial stages of HRT or when the dose is adjusted, breakthrough bleeding and spotting are very common.
2. INFECTIONS
2. Infections
Vaginitis:It is an inflammation of the vagina that can result in discharge, itching, pain, and spotting between periods.
Cervicitis:It refers to irritation or infection of the cervix. Bleeding between periods is a common symptom of cervicitis.
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID):It is an infection of the upper reproductive organs, including the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. It can lead to irregular menstrual periods.

3. LAB TESTS
3. Lab tests
Complete Blood Count (CBC):It helps in identifying low red blood cell count and potential underlying causes.
Blood pregnancy test (HCG Beta Total Maternal):This blood test measures hCG levels in pregnant women's blood, helping in identifying hormonal changes and potential causes of bleeding, including miscarriage or early pregnancy-related issues.
Thyroid tests:These tests diagnose any imbalance in thyroid hormones, a potential cause for bleeding between periods.
Urine analysis:Spotting can also be a sign of early pregnancy. Urine analysis checks whether human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (HCG or hCG) is present in the urine or not.
ProgesteroneandEstrogentest:These hormones regulate the menstrual cycle and their imbalance can cause irregular bleeding.
Coagulation panel:This test measures the blood's ability to clot, and how long it takes to clot. A woman having problems with clotting can also have vaginal bleeding between periods.
Pap smear:Also called a Pap test, this procedure is used to test for cervical cancer in women. This test involves collecting cells from the cervix and can help in detecting abnormal cells in the cervix before they become cancerous and cause vaginal bleeding amongst other symptoms.

4. IMAGING TESTS
4. Imaging tests
Transvaginal ultrasound:It involves inserting a small ultrasound probe into the vagina to produce detailed images of the pelvic organs. This is a first-line imaging test for the evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding.
Lower abdomen ultrasound: This imaging test uses sound waves to visualize the inside of the uterus to detect any fibroids or polyps.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This is a non-invasive imaging technology that produces three-dimensional detailed anatomical images of the uterus.
Hysteroscopy: It is a procedure used to examine the inside of the womb (uterus). A hysteroscope, which is a narrow telescope with a light and camera at the end and is passed through the vagina. This procedure allows one to look inside the uterus to diagnose and treat the causes of abnormal bleeding.
Saline infusion sonography: In this test, saline is infused into the uterus for a clearer ultrasound image. It gives a better picture of the inside of the uterus, and small abnormalities can be detected easily.
