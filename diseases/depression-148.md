DEPRESSION
DepressionAlso known as Melancholia and Pessimism
OVERVIEW
Overview
Depression is a common mental health disorder that causes persistent sadness, loss of interest, and low energy, affecting how a person feels, thinks, and functions daily. A mix of biological, psychological, and social factors, such as chemical imbalances in the brain, stressful life events, chronic illness, or a family history of depression, can lead to depression.


Low mood, feeling of hopelessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, poor sleep and appetite changes, and in severe cases, thoughts of self-harm are some of the symptoms of depression. Risk factors include genetics, traumatic experiences, certain medical conditions, substance abuse, and prolonged stress.


Treatment often involves a combination of psychotherapy, like cognitive-behavioral therapy, antidepressant medications, and lifestyle changes such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, and adequate sleep. Support from family and friends plays a crucial role. With timely help, most people with depression can recover and lead fulfilling lives. Seeking early professional care is key to better outcomes.

CAUSES OF DEPRESSION
Causes Of Depression

The exact cause of depression is not fully understood. It can develop spontaneously, without an obvious trigger, or in response to life events. Current research suggests that depression arises from a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors, often called the biopsychosocial model.


What happens in depression?

The brain contains billions of nerve cells (neurons) that communicate via chemical messengers known as neurotransmitters.
These help regulate mood, thoughts, and emotions, and are crucial for mental well-being.
In depression, certain parts of the brain that control mood don’t work together as they should
The balance of brain chemicals like serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine is disturbed
Also, in some people, brain scans show a smaller hippocampus, the part linked to memory and emotions, which may happen when long-term stress or other factors slow down the growth of new brain cells.

Anxiety and depression can often show up together, making daily life feel heavier than it should. Understanding the difference can help you make sense of what you’re going for. through. Watch this video to know the difference.

TYPES OF DEPRESSION
Types Of Depression


Depressive disorders, including depression, are mood conditions marked by persistent sadness, loss of interest, and impaired daily functioning. They vary in duration, severity, and triggers, but all involve disruptions in mood regulation. Some common types include:



MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD)
Major depressive disorder (MDD)
This is characterized by a persistent low mood that lasts at least two weeks and causes significant impairment in daily functioning.
MDD can occur as a single episode or recur multiple times in a lifetime.

PERSISTENT DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (PDD OR DYSTHYMIA)
Persistent depressive disorder (PDD or dysthymia)
A chronic form of depression with a low mood lasting at least 2 years and 1 year in children or adolescents.
People with PDD may experience episodes of major depression called “double depression.

OTHER SPECIFIED OR UNSPECIFIED DEPRESSIVE DISORDER
Other specified or unspecified depressive disorder
Used when depressive symptoms cause significant distress, with fewer symptoms and a short duration.

ADJUSTMENT DISORDER WITH DEPRESSED MOOD
Adjustment disorder with depressed mood
Depressive symptoms that develop within3 monthsof a major life stressor like loss of a loved one, divorce, or job loss, and improve within6 monthsafter the stressor or its consequences end.

BIPOLAR DISORDERWITH DEPRESSIVE EPISODES
Bipolar disorderwith depressive episodes
A mood disorder with alternating episodes of mania or hypomania, elevated or irritable mood, increased activity, decreased need for sleep, and symptoms of depression.
Depressive episodes in bipolar disorder can resemble MDD but require different treatment approaches.

SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER (SAD)
Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)
A form of depression with a seasonal pattern, typically occurring during winter months due to reduced sunlight exposure.
SAD is considered a specifier for MDD or PDD rather than a separate disorder.

RISK FACTORS FOR DEPRESSION
Risk Factors For Depression

Anyone can suffer from depression, even a person who appears to live in relatively ideal circumstances. However, many potential factors can trigger or influence depression:

BIOLOGICAL FACTORS
Biological factors

Family history and genetics:Depression, especially bipolar disorder, can run in families, but requires environmental triggers.

Inflammation:Chronic disease or stress-related inflammation may alter brain chemistry, increasing depression risk and affecting treatment response.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI):Concussions or head injuries from falls, accidents, or sports.

Medications:Certain drugs for high blood pressure, seizures, cancer, anxiety, sleep, or alcohol dependence can lead to depression.

Circadian rhythm disruption:Shift work, irregular sleep, reduced sunlight exposure.

Poor diet:Deficiency in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, imbalanced omega-6/omega-3 ratio, and high sugar intake are also related to depression.

PSYCHOLOGICAL OR SOCIAL FACTORS
Psychological or social factors
History of abuse (physical, emotional, or sexual)Loneliness or social isolationLow socioeconomic statusStressful life events like loss of a loved one, divorce, job loss, or financial crisesPositive but disruptive changes like marriage, moving house, graduation, and retirementPersonality traits like low self-esteem, pessimism, self-criticism, and poor coping skills

DIAGNOSIS OF DEPRESSION
Diagnosis Of Depression

The diagnosis of depression is based on history and physical findings. No diagnostic laboratory tests are available to diagnose major depressive disorder.

1. PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION
1. Psychiatric evaluation

It is a comprehensive evaluation needed to diagnose emotional, behavioral, or developmental disorders.
The evaluation may include a description of behaviors like how long the changed behavior lasts, and what the conditions are in which the behaviors most often happen
A complete medical history, including description of the person's overall physical health, list of any other illnesses or conditions present, and any current ongoing treatments.

DSM-5 GUIDELINES
DSM-5 guidelines

These are the 9 symptoms listed in the DSM-5. Five must be present to make the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (one of the symptoms should be depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure):

Sleep disturbance
Interest/pleasure reduction
Guilt feelings or thoughts of worthlessness
Energy changes/fatigue
Concentration/attention impairment
Appetite/weight changes
Psychomotor disturbances
Suicidal thoughts
Depressed mood

2. BLOOD TESTS
2. Blood tests

Blood tests can help in the exclusion of any underlying medical conditions that can manifest as depression. These include:



Complete blood cell (CBC) count:Detects anemia or infections that can mimic or worsen depressive symptoms.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH):Screens for hypothyroidism, a common reversible cause of low mood and fatigue.

Vitamin B-12:Identifies deficiencies that can cause depression, cognitive changes, and fatigue.

Rapid plasma reagin (RPR):This test is done to screen forsyphilis, since untreated syphilis (especially neurosyphilis) can cause mood changes, cognitive issues, or depression-like symptoms.

Toxic screening:To rule out active substance abuse.

HIV test:Detects infections that can present with neuropsychiatric symptoms, including depression.

Serum electrolytes:This test finds imbalances that may affect brain function and mood regulation.

LFT and KFT (Liver and kidney function test):Checks for chronic organ disease that can cause fatigue, cognitive slowing, and mood changes.

Blood and urine toxicology screen:Identifies substance use that can trigger or worsen depressive symptoms.



Note: Arterial blood gas (ABG), dexamethasone suppression test, and ACTH stimulation test are not routine; only indicated for specific suspected conditions like Cushing's disease orAddison's disease.

3. IMAGING TESTS
3. Imaging tests

Just like blood tests, imaging tests can help rule out other medical causes and conditions. These include:

CT scan:Detects structural brain abnormalities, strokes, or tumors that can cause depressive symptoms.

MRI brain:Provides detailed imaging to identify lesions, demyelination, or neurodegenerative changes linked to mood disorders.

TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION
Treatment Of Depression

Depression is among the most treatable of mental disorders. The treatment of depression involves both pharmacological (medical) and psychological approaches.

1. MEDICAL THERAPY
1. Medical therapy

a. SSRIs (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors):These medicines help increase “feel-good” brain chemicals to improve mood and reduce anxiety. Examples of this class of drugs include:
EscitalopramFluoxetineSertralineParoxetine

b. SNRIs (Serotonin and nor-adrenaline reuptake inhibitors):These lift mood and also help reduce certain types of body pain by balancing brain chemicals. Common drugs include:
DuloxetineMilnacipranVenlafaxine

c. MAO (Monoamine oxidase) inhibitors:These are older antidepressants that improve mood but require strict diet and drug precautions. Examples include:PhenelzineIsocarboxazidTranylcypromine

d. TCA (Tricyclic antidepressants):These are older medicines that boost mood but may cause more side effects like dry mouth (xerostomia) and drowsiness. Examples of these drugs include:NortriptylineAmitriptylineImipramine

Note:Selegiline, a newer MAOI that sticks on the skin as a patch, may cause fewer side effects than other MAOIs do.



e. Atypical depressants:These work in unique ways to improve mood when standard treatments aren’t enough.  Some of the common examples of these medications are:
MirtazapineAgomelatineBupropionAtomoxetine

2. PSYCHOTHERAPY
2. Psychotherapy

Also known as talk therapy or psychological therapy, it is a common approach used for treating depression by talking about your condition and related issues in the form of counseling sessions with a mental health professional. These include:

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT):This type of psychological therapy helps teach the person coping skills to manage their difficult conditions. The therapy focuses on the cognitive component. This helps the person to change their thinking about a particular situation and the behavioral component, which further helps them to change their reactions to any situation.

Interpersonal therapy (IPT):This is a time-limited approach that focuses on improving the symptoms of depression and treating mood disorders. In this, a therapist emphatically engages with the person with depression to improve their communication with others and solve the problem.

3. SURGICAL AND OTHER INTERVENTIONS
3. Surgical and other interventions

Electro-convulsive therapy (ECT):Also known as shock therapy, this mode of treatment is the best for acute depression. It is also useful for people who do not respond to drug therapy, are psychotic, or are suicidal or dangerous to themselves.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS):It is usually reserved for those who haven't responded to antidepressants. During TMS, a treatment coil is placed against your scalp, which sends brief magnetic pulses to stimulate nerve cells in your brain that are involved in mood regulation and depression.
Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS):This approach is also used in refractory cases. Like ECT, it uses electrical stimulation to relieve the symptoms of depression. The difference is that the device is surgically implanted in your body. VNS is FDA-approved for the long-term (not acute) depression of chronic depression that does not respond to at least two antidepressant trials.


COMPLICATIONS OF DEPRESSION
Complications Of Depression

If left untreated, depression can lead to serious emotional, physical, and social problems that affect every area of life. These can include:

Substance use disorders:Some individuals may turn to alcohol or drugs as a coping mechanism.

Relationship difficulties:Depression can strain personal and professional relationships due to withdrawal, irritability, or loss of interest.

Chronic physical illnesses:These are associated with worsened outcomes in heart disease, diabetes, and chronic pain conditions.

Poor work or academic performance:Reduced concentration and motivation can lead to job loss or poor grades.

Anxiety disorders:Depression frequently co-occurs with generalized anxiety, panic disorder, or Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Weakened immune function:Chronic stress and low mood can impair immune response, making illness more likely.

Social isolation:Withdrawal from friends and family can deepen feelings of loneliness and worsen depression.
Suicidal thoughts or behaviors:Persistent feelings of hopelessness can increase the risk of self-harm or suicide.


ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR DEPRESSION
Alternative Therapies For Depression

Some alternate approaches may help support emotional well-being, but they should be considered adjuncts and not replacements for evidence-based medical treatments like medication or psychotherapy. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider before starting any alternative therapy. The recipes that can help include:

ACUPUNCTURE
Acupuncture
An ancient Chinese practice involving the insertion of fine needles at specific points on the body to restore energy balance. Some studies suggest it may help improve mood by modulating neurotransmitter activity, though high-quality evidence is still limited.

AROMATHERAPY
Aromatherapy
Uses essential oils such as lavender, bergamot, or rose through inhalation or massage to promote relaxation and reduce anxiety. While pleasant and soothing, its antidepressant effects are generally mild and best used alongside other therapies.

YOGA
Yoga
It combines physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation to improve flexibility, reduce stress hormones, and promote mindfulness. Regular practice may help ease depressive symptoms and improve sleep.

MINDFULNESS MEDITATION
Mindfulness meditation
Involves focusing on the present moment without judgment, which can reduce rumination and negative thinking patterns. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is a structured program that has shown benefits in preventing depression relapse.

MUSIC THERAPY
Music therapy
A therapeutic approach where listening to or creating music is used to improve mood, reducestress, and enhance emotional expression. Particularly useful for individuals who find verbal expression challenging.Did You Know?

To overcome this condition, it is important for you to love yourself

4. GET MOVING
4. Get moving
Depression tends to keep you in bed or glued to your couch. The less you move around, the worse it may get
Go for a 20-minute walk every day with a friend or alone. You could also pick a sport that interests you or any other physical activity that would keep you moving
Exercise has been found to increase the production of neurochemicals such as endorphins that elevate the mood and make you happy

5. GET SOME SUNSHINE
5. Get some sunshine
Studies suggest that sunlight has a therapeutic effect on those suffering from depression. Sunlight has been found to boost depressed mood and serve as a therapy.
Take short walks outdoors in the sunlight. Instead of opting to have coffee/ tea in a dark room, try doing the same in the sun
If you practice yoga, do it during the early morning hours and enjoy the benefits of sunlight as well

6. HAVE MOOD-ENHANCING FOODS
6. Have mood-enhancing foods
While fighting depression, include foods that are rich in B complex, Vitamin C, and Omega-3 Fatty acids
Omega-3 rich foods (rich in EPA and DHA) have been found to stabilize mood swings. Include foods such as fatty fish or fish oil supplements in your diet.
Do not skip your meals. Make sure you eat after regular hours (2-3 hours).
Minimize the intake of sugars and refined carbs, such as bakery items, pasta, as they may lead to an energy crash.

If you are unable to meet your dietary requirements, consider omega supplements after consulting with your doctor.

DEPRESSION AND RELATED CONDITIONS
Depression and related conditions
Diabetes:The prevalence rates of depression could be up to three times higher in people with type 1 diabetes and twice as high in people with type 2 diabetes compared with the general population worldwide. The common cause could be stress and inflammation, as both promote depression and DM2, giving a feasible common link between them.
Heart disease:Depression is known to be associated with poorer outcomes of chronic heart disease (CHD). Depression can act as a risk factor for a poor prognosis after aheart attackor unstable angina (chest pain at rest due to reduced blood flow to the heart).

DEPRESSION AND OTHER MENTAL DISORDERS
Depression and other mental disorders
Anxiety disorders:.Studies have shown that more than 70% of individuals with depressive disorders also have anxiety symptoms, and 40 to 70% simultaneously met criteria for at least one type of anxiety disorder. The concurrent presence of anxiety symptoms or anxiety disorders often complicates the treatment of depressive disorders.
Schizophrenia:Although technically, depression and schizophrenia are different, it is seen that depressed mood is commonly associated with first-episode schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, behaves, and interacts with his/her surroundings. Moreover, it is reported that these symptoms impair the everyday life of the patient as well as the quality of life, which requires medical treatment as well as hospitalization, in some cases.
Eating disorders:Both depressive disorders and eating disorders are complex and varied, often occurring together. They are more common in women and girls, though men and boys are also significantly affected.
Substance abuse:It’s no secret that there is a strong connection between substance use and mental illness. A strong link between depression with substance use, and impairment would suggest that depressed substance users may require enhanced treatment interventions.

Phobias:Phobias are a form of anxiety disorder, wherein a person will have an irrational, all-encompassing fear of a person, place, thing, or a specific situation. Unfortunately, depression and anxiety are closely linked. Some of the common phobias include:Aviophobia/aerophobia (fear of flying)Emetophobia (fear of vomiting)Amaxophobia (fear of driving)Did our information help you?In our relentless endeavour to keep improving our services, you are our eyes.
