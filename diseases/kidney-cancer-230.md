KIDNEY CANCER
Kidney cancerAlso known as Renal cancer or Hypernephroma
OVERVIEW
Overview
Kidney cancer occurs when healthy cells in one or both kidneys grow out of control and form a lump (called a tumor).The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, located behind the abdominal organs, with one kidney on each side of the spine. They filter the blood and remove waste material and excess water by making urine that is expelled as waste.

During the early stages, most people don’t have any signs or symptoms of cancer. Kidney cancer is usually detected by chance during an abdominal imaging test. As the tumor grows, a person may have symptoms like blood in the urine, pain in the lower back, a lump or swelling in the kidney area or abdomen, and losing weight for no reason.

The major risk factor for kidney cancer is smoking. Other factors includehigh blood pressure,diabetes,obesity,kidney stones, long term dialysis, certain genetic conditions, and being exposed to certain chemicals.

Treatment of kidney cancer includes one of or a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, embolization, biological therapy, and surgery. After treatment, follow-up care is essential to monitor recovery and to check for any possible recurrence of kidney cancer.

CAUSES OF KIDNEY CANCER
Causes Of Kidney Cancer

Cancer occurs due to changes in DNA, which contains genes that control cell growth and division.
Oncogenes promote cell growth, while tumor suppressor genes regulate it or cause cells to die at the right time.
DNA mutations can activate oncogenes or deactivate tumor suppressor genes, leading to uncontrolled cell growth.
Certain factors can increase the likelihood of these mutations leading to kidney cancer.

TYPES OF KIDNEY CANCER
Types Of Kidney Cancer

Kidney cancer can be classified into different types based on the cells where it originates and how it grows. It includes:

1. RENAL CELL CARCINOMA
1. Renal cell carcinoma
This is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults which often stays confined to the linings of tiny tubes in the kidney called renal tubules.
Sometimes cancer can spread to other parts of the body, most often the bones, lungs, or brain.


2. CLEAR CELL RENAL CELL CARCINOMA
2. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma
This is also called conventional renal cell carcinoma and is named after how the tumor looks under the microscope.
The cells in the tumor look clear, like bubbles.
In adults, renal clear cell carcinoma makes up 80% of the cases while 2% to 6% of childhood and young adult kidney cancer cases.


3. RARE TYPE OF KIDNEY CANCER
3. Rare type of kidney cancer
Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC):The tumor in the kidney tubes is found in 15% of all renal cell carcinomas.
Translocation renal cell carcinoma (TRCC):It is a slow-growing tumor in the kidney. This accounts for 1% to 5% of all renal cell carcinomas and 20% of childhood cases.
RISK FACTORS OF KIDNEY CANCER
Risk Factors Of Kidney Cancer

A risk factor is anything that increases your chance of getting a disease. Risk factors for kidney cancer can include:
1. NON-MODIFIABLE FACTORS
1. Non-modifiable factors
Age:The incidence of kidney cancer increases with age, with a peak of incidence at approximately 75 years of age.
Sex:The incidence of kidney cancer is two-fold higher in men compared with women.
Genetic risk factors:Certain rare inherited conditions may increase the risk of kidney cancer.
Family history of kidney cancer.The risk of kidney cancer increases if first-line relatives or close family members have the condition.

2. MODIFIABLE FACTORS
2. Modifiable factors

DIAGNOSIS OF KIDNEY CANCER
Diagnosis Of Kidney Cancer

Understanding the staging of kidney cancer is crucial before diagnosis.


The staging system used for kidney cancer is based on the TNM system
The size and extent of the main tumor (T): Is it confined to the same area or it has grown into nearby areas?
The spread to nearby lymph nodes (N)
The spread (metastasis) to distant sites (M): It has spread to nearby organs such as the brain, bones, or lungs.


Note:Higher stage numbers indicate more advanced cancer. T, N, and M categories are combined through stage grouping to determine the overall stage, which helps diagnose kidney cancer.

Diagnosis consists of:
1. MEDICAL HISTORY OR PHYSICAL EXAM
1. Medical history or physical exam
If kidney cancer is suspected, the doctor will review your medical history, ask about symptoms, and check for risk factors.
They may conduct a physical exam, check for lumps or swelling, and order blood tests to identify potential kidney issues.


2. BLOOD TESTS
2. Blood tests
Urine tests:Urine tests can detect hidden blood or cancer cells, which may indicate kidney or bladder cancer.
Complete blood count:This test measures the number of different cells in the blood. This test result is often abnormal in people with kidney cancer.
Kidney Function Test:It assesses how well the kidneys are working and help detect abnormalities linked to kidney cancer.


3. IMAGING TESTS
3. Imaging tests
Magnetic Resonance Imagining (MRI) scan:A scan that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce a detailed image of your kidneys.
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan:A detailed body scan that can be helpful for investigating confirmed cases of kidney cancer to see if cancer has spread and how well it's responding to treatment.
Ultrasound scan:It can be helpful in finding a kidney mass and showing if it is solid or filled with fluid.
Computed tomography (CT) scan:The CT scan uses X-rays to make detailed cross-sectional images of your body. It can provide precise information about the size, shape, and location of a tumor.
Angiography:It is an x-ray test that looks at blood vessels. It can also diagnose renal cancers since the blood vessels usually have a special appearance with this test.
Bone scan:This test is helpful to check if cancer has spread to the bones.
Cystoscopy:Where a thin tube is passed up your urethra (the tube that carries urine out of your body) so that problems in the bladder can be detected.
Chest x-ray:An x-ray may be done after kidney cancer has been diagnosed to check if the cancer has spread to the lungs.


4. BIOPSY
4. Biopsy
A biopsy might be done to get a small sample of tissue from an area that may be cancer when the imaging tests are not clear enough to permit surgery.
Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)and needle core biopsy are 2 types of kidney biopsies that may be done.
In cases where the doctors think kidney cancer might have spread to other sites, they may take a biopsy of the metastatic site instead of the kidney.

TREATMENT OF KIDNEY CANCER
Treatment Of Kidney Cancer

The treatment for kidney cancer depends on the size of the cancer and whether it has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic).  The treatment consists of:

1. SURGERY
1. Surgery
Partial nephrectomy: Removes only the tumor, preserving kidney function.
Radical nephrectomy: Removes the entire kidney, nearby tissues, and sometimes lymph nodes.


2. TARGETED THERAPIES
2. Targeted therapies
It is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to specifically target and block cancer-causing genes, proteins, or tissues while minimizing damage to healthy cells. The medicines included in the targeted therapies include:EverolimusBevacizumabNivolumabTivozanibSunitinibPazopanibCabozantinibAxitinib


3. ABLATION THERAPIES
3. Ablation therapies
These treatments destroy cancer cells by either:Freezing cancer cells (Cryotherapy):It is done by inserting needles into the tumor. This can be done through a small cut (laparoscopic cryotherapy).Heating cancer cells (radiofrequency ablation):It is done by inserting a needle-like probe through your skin, so no large cuts are needed.

4. RADIOTHERAPY
4. Radiotherapy
It is a treatment where radiation is used to target or destroy cancerous cells.
It is advised in advanced kidney cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, such as your bones or brain, radiotherapy
It cannot usually cure kidney cancer, but it can slow down its spread and help control your symptoms.


5. EMBOLIZATION
5. Embolization
Embolization is a procedure to block the blood supply to the tumor, causing it to shrink. D
During embolization, a small tube called a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in your groin and then guided to the blood vessel supplying the tumor.
