EXCESSIVE SWEATING
Excessive sweatingAlso known as Hyperhidrosis
OVERVIEW
Overview
Excessive sweating, known as hyperhidrosis, is a condition characterized by uncontrollable and profuse sweating beyond what is necessary for temperature regulation. It can occur in specific areas such as the armpits, palms, and soles of the feet, or affect the entire body.  It affects both men and women equally, but women tend to seek more care.

While the exact cause is not always known, excessive sweating can be due to certain underlying medical conditions, medications, or hormonal imbalances. It can also be triggered by certain foods and emotional stress.

Treatment options range from conservative measures such as antiperspirants, clothing modifications, and lifestyle changes, to more advanced approaches like medications, iontophoresis, botox injections, and surgical interventions.

TYPES OF EXCESSIVE SWEATING
Types of Excessive Sweating

There are two major types of excessive sweating:

Primary hyperhidrosis:It is usually seen if one of the family members may have had it. Studies suggest that primary hyperhidrosis begins in childhood and worsens with puberty, especially in women.
Secondary hyperhidrosis:It is caused by some other condition or behavior like neurologic syndromes, thyrotoxicosis,diabetes mellitus,gout,menopause, chronic alcoholism, etc.
Apart from these, there are other types of excessive sweating that include:
Night sweats:These are generally associated with menopause, infection, malignancy, or endocrine disease. Also, fluctuating sleep depth due to sleep apnoea, pains, restless legs, etc., can cause excessive sweating.
Food-triggered (Gustatory) sweating:Everyone knows that your face sweats when you consume highly spiced food. This gustatory hyperhidrosis is seen following salivary gland surgery and is then called Frey’s syndrome. It is also seen in uncontrolled diabetes.
CAUSES OF EXCESSIVE SWEATING
Causes Of Excessive Sweating

Our body has a mechanism to regulate sweating. However, in excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis), this mechanism may not work properly. The negative feedback to the hypothalamus, a structure deep within your brain, which tells it to stop signaling the sweat glands, may be impaired. As a result, the body ends up sweating more than necessary to cool down.
RISK FACTORS FOR EXCESSIVE SWEATING
Risk Factors For Excessive Sweating

Excessive sweating is a general feature seen during hot and humid conditions. However, if it is chronic then it can lead to discomfort. There are certain triggers that can lead to excessive sweating. They include:
1. GENETICS
1. Genetics
Several studies suggest that primary hyperhidrosis has a genetic component as demonstrated by the high frequency of positive family histories.
2. FEVER
2. Fever

7. CHRONIC EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION
7. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption
Excessive sweating in palms and soles is frequently observed in patients with a clinical history of chronic abnormal alcoholic intake.
8. TUMORS
8. Tumors
Excessive sweating can occur in cancer or cancer treatment. Tumors such as pheochromocytoma (a rare tumor that usually forms in the adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys) and lymphoma (cancer of the lymphatic system) known to cause hyperhidrosis.
DIAGNOSIS OF EXCESSIVE SWEATING
Diagnosis Of Excessive Sweating

To diagnose excessive sweating, it is important to first determine whether the source is primary or secondary and this can be done through a thorough history. The diagnosis consists of the following:
1. HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
1. History and physical examination
Diagnosis of excessive sweating is usually made by a visual inspection. A family history and medical history can determine primary or secondary hyperhidrosis.
Primary hyperhidrosis is more commonly seen in the younger population. Symptoms that present later in life are mostly linked to a secondary cause.
2. STARCH-IODINE TEST
2. Starch-iodine test
In this test iodine solution is applied to the skin and starch powder is applied on top of that. As soon as those substances are in contact with sweat, they turn violet in color.
The distribution pattern of the color (or absence of it) helps in the identification of excessive sweating.
3. QUANTITATIVE SUDOMETRY
3. Quantitative sudometry
The quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test (QSART) is a quantitative test assessing sweat glands innervated by small nerve fibers.
4. FILTER PAPER TEST
4. Filter paper test
This test is suitable to detect excessive sweating in the armpits. A pre-weighed filter paper is inserted into the armpit for a defined time period (60 sec or 5 min) and then weighed again. The difference corresponds to the amount of sweat released in mg/time can help diagnose hyperhidrosis.
5. OTHER TESTS
5. Other tests
If a secondary cause is suspected, a complete work-up is done to rule out infection, kidney dysfunction, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, an inflammatory disorder, or connective tissue disease. Some of these tests include:
Complete blood count (CBC)
Basic metabolic panel
Thyroid-stimulating hormone(TSH)
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR)
Antinuclear antibody
Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C)
Chest x-ray

TREATMENT OF EXCESSIVE SWEATING
Treatment Of Excessive Sweating

There are several treatment options available to manage or treat excessive sweating. These include:
1. TOPICAL APPLICATIONS
1. Topical applications
Generally, topical applications are suitable only for cases of focal hyperhidrosis. The most commonly used ones include:
Antiperspirants:These are products designed to reduce sweat or perspiration on the skin. They are available in creams, powders, and sprays. Aluminum salts are added to many topical antiperspirants.
Astringents:These act by contraction or tightening of body tissues. In case of excessive sweating, they work by constricting the skin's pores, reducing sweat production, and providing a drying effect.

2. ORAL MEDICATIONS
2. Oral Medications
Oral medication is reserved for treatment-resistant cases or generalized hyperhidrosis. Medications used include:
Anticholinergics:These are the most commonly used oral medications. Examples include:
Glycopyrrolate
Bornaprine
Methantheline bromide

Alpha-adrenergic agonists:These are used to treat localized types of excessive sweating.Clonidineis the most commonly used drug.

Calcium channel blockers:Calcium channel blockers likediltiazeminhibit the calcium-dependent release of acetylcholine and help to reduce sweating.

Other drugs:Beta-blockers (likepropranolol)and benzodiazepines (likediazepam)are used to reduce anxiety-related excessive sweating.

3. IONTOPHORESIS
3. Iontophoresis
It is the process of passing a weak electrical current through the skin to block the sweat glands.
The current is applied usually for 10-20 minutes per session, initially with 2 to 3 sessions per week. It is followed by maintenance sessions at 1 to 3 week intervals, depending upon the patient's response.
Iontophoresis may sound painful but is not.

4. BOTOX INJECTIONS
4. Botox injections
Injection of botox (botulinum toxin) is an effective therapy for excessive sweating of the armpits, hands, feet, armpit, and face.
It works by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine, the chemical that activates sweat glands.
The injections can be uncomfortable, but the use of a very small needle helps to minimize discomfort.
They usually give around six months of relief from sweating.

5. SURGERY
5. Surgery
It is the last resort when all other treatment modalities show no positive results. These include:
Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy:This surgery is used to treat sweating of the palms or face. The sympathetic nerves control sweating. A sympathectomy is an irreversible procedure during which at least one sympathetic ganglion (relay station between the nerves) is removed.
Removal of axillary(armpit) sweat glands:Sweat glands in the armpit (axilla) is removed by means of axillary curettage (removal of tissue) or liposuction (removal of fat).
