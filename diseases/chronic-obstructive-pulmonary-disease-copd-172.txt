CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD)
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)Also known as Emphysema or Chronic bronchitis
OVERVIEW
Overview
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a long-term lung condition that causes breathing difficulties due to airflow blockage and inflammation. COPD is the second leading cause of mortality in India, contributing to over one million lives lost each year.


COPD often develops gradually, with symptoms like persistentcough, breathlessness, wheezing, and excess mucus. These symptoms are commonly triggered by factors like long-term smoking, air pollution, occupational exposure to dust or chemicals, and a history of respiratory infections orasthma.


The management of COPD focuses on relieving symptoms and improving quality of life through bronchodilators, inhaled steroids, and pulmonary rehabilitation. Quitting smoking and avoiding lung irritants are essential. In severe cases, oxygen therapy or surgery may be recommended.

CAUSES OF COPD
Causes Of COPD

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a long-term lung disease that causesinflammation/swelling and blocks airflow, making it hard to breathe.
This damage often results fromsmoking or air pollution, which harms the tiny air sacs in the lungs called alveoli.
As the lungs lose their elasticity, air gets trapped during exhalation, leading to shortness of breath.
In rare cases, a condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)can also cause lung damage.
This genetic issue reduces the lungs’ protection against harmful enzymes, leading to damage similar to smoking-related COPD.
People with COPD often have difficulty exhaling fully, causing a buildup of carbon dioxide in the body.
Over time, the lungs can become overinflated and less efficient at exchanging gases. Several factors can raise the risk of developing COPD, which will be explored in the following section.


Healthy lungs support easy breathing, better oxygen flow, and a stronger immune system. Take care of them with our trusted products.

RISK FACTORS FOR COPD
Risk Factors For COPD

Tobacco smoking accounts for over70% of COPDcases. Other risk factors can include:



Secondhand smoke:Breathing in smoke from others around you can damage your lungs over time and increase COPD risk.

Air pollution:Long-term exposure to polluted air can irritate and inflame your lungs.



Air pollution affects your health depending on exposure levels, duration, and existing health conditions. Understand its impact on your body with the Pollution Risk Check Advanced Package.
Book Your Test Now


Fumes and dust:Breathing in chemicals, dust, or smoke from cooking or workplaces can increase your likelihood of developing COPD.

Lung development problems:Poor lung growth in the womb or childhood (due to asthma or pollution) can increase the risk.

Infections:Conditions likeHIV infectionsortuberculosiscan weaken your lungs and raise your chances of getting COPD.

Age:Risk goes up with age, especially if you've been exposed to other risk factors like smoking.

Family history:Having close relatives with COPD may increase your risk, especially if you also smoke.

Genetic condition (AAT deficiency):A rare inherited problem that makes lungs more vulnerable to damage.

Small airways:Some people are born with smaller airways, which can raise COPD risk even without smoking.
Race or ethnicity:American Indian or Alaska Native populations, and those of more than one race, may have a higher risk of COPD.
DIAGNOSIS OF COPD
Diagnosis Of COPD

Early diagnosis of COPD is important to slow disease progression, manage symptoms effectively, and improve quality of life. Diagnostic tests include:


1. HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
1. History and physical examination
Individuals with persistent cough, shortness of breath, or frequent mucus production, especially with a history of smoking or exposure to pollutants, are suspected for COPD.

Signs such as a barrel-shaped chest, distant breath sounds, or reduced air movement may be present on examination.

2.PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS (PFTS)
2.Pulmonary function tests (PFTs)

Spirometry:This is the key test for diagnosing COPD. It measures how much air you can breathe out and how fast.

Try simple tools like lung exercisers to support your lung health daily.

Lung volume testing:It measures the total amount of air the lungs can hold. It is done if basic spirometry is unclear or another lung issue is suspected.

Diffusing capacity (DLCO): It measures how well your lungs transfer oxygen into your blood; it helps identify emphysema.

3. LAB TESTS
3. Lab tests

Complete blood count (CBC):Helps detect infections, anemia, or high red blood cell counts (polycythemia), which can occur in COPD.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin levels:This test is done to rule out a genetic cause of COPD, especially in younger individuals or those without a history of smoking.

Arterial blood gas (ABG):This test measures oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, especially in advanced disease.

Pulse oximetry:It helps detect low blood oxygen levels, which can indicate impaired lung function in COPD.

For people with COPD or other respiratory conditions, oxygen levels can drop without obvious symptoms. A pulse oximeter helps you track your oxygen saturation easily at home and catch early signs of trouble, especially during flare-ups or winter infections.

Bullectomy:A procedure to remove large air pockets (bullae) that interfere with breathing and healthy lung tissue.

Lung volume reduction surgery:Damaged, non-functioning lung sections are removed to improve airflow and make breathing easier.

Lung transplant:It is considered for very severe cases in carefully selected patients when other treatments no longer work.
COMPLICATIONS OF COPD
Complications Of COPD

COPD can lead to several serious complications that affect not just the lungs but multiple organs and overall quality of life. These include:


Acute exacerbation of COPD: Asudden worsening of symptoms of COPD, like breathlessness, cough, and sputum, often triggered by infections or pollution.

Acute and/or chronic respiratory failure:Occurs when the lungs can't provide enough oxygen or remove carbon dioxide. This can lead to life-threatening complications.

Pulmonary hypertension:High blood pressurein the lungs' arteries, caused by long-term low oxygen levels from COPD.

Cor pulmonale:It is right-sidedheart failuredue to increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries from chronic lung disease.

Weight loss:Unintentional weight loss is common in advanced cases of COPD due to increased energy use for breathing and poor appetite.

Bacterial infections:People with COPD are more prone to lung infections likepneumoniaandbronchitis, which can worsen symptoms.

Adverse reactions to glucocorticoids:Long-term use of steroids in COPD can cause side effects such as high blood sugar, bone thinning, and increased infection risk.

Osteoporosis:People with COPD often develop weaker bones due to smoking, poor nutrition, low activity, and steroid use, increasing the risk of fractures.

Cognitive and nervous system problems:Low oxygen levels due to COPD can affect memory, thinking, and nerves, leading to confusion, depression, or even muscle cramps.

Depressionandanxiety:Emotional distress is common in COPD due to the chronic nature of the disease, and it may worsen breathlessness or treatment adherence.

Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD):Acid reflux is common in COPD and may worsen breathing issues or lead to more frequent flare-ups.

Anaemia:COPD may cause chronic anaemia, worsening fatigue, and reduced quality of life.

ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR COPD
Alternative Therapies For COPD

Complementary or supportive therapies can help them cope better with COPD symptoms such as breathlessness, fatigue, and anxiety. These therapies should never replace prescribed treatments. Always talk to your doctor before starting any new therapy.

Therapies that can help include:

1. ACUPUNCTURE
1. Acupuncture

Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese therapy that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body to stimulate healing and balance energy flow. It may help reduce symptoms like breathlessness and improve quality of life by promoting relaxation and reducing inflammation. But larger-scale research is needed to confirm its effectiveness and safety.

2. YOGA
2. Yoga

Yoga can improve breathing control, lung function, and overall well-being through breathing exercises and gentle movements. However, more rigorous studies are required to fully understand its benefits and best practices for people with COPD.

3. MUSCLE STRENGTHENING THERAPY
3. Muscle strengthening therapy

Electrical stimulation is not used very often. It may be used only during flare-ups to maintain or improve muscle strength when physical activity isn't possible.



4. SUPPLEMENTS
4. Supplements

NAC (N-Acetylcysteine):A supplement that may thin mucus and ease cough in COPD, but current research shows limited evidence of significant benefit.
