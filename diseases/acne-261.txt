ACNE
AcneAlso known as Acne vulgaris, and Pimples
OVERVIEW
Overview

Acne is a common condition that most of us have dealt with at some point in our lives. Acne, or acne vulgaris, is a skin condition in which the pores and hair follicles of the skin get clogged with sebum, an oily, wax-textured substance secreted from the skin glands. Though the face is the most commonly affected area, acne can occur anywhere on the body, like the chest, shoulders, and upper back.

Acne is mainly of two types, comedogenic and non-comedogenic. Comedogenic acne is mainly non-inflammatory and can be seen in the form of whiteheads and blackheads. On the other hand, non-comedogenic acne is inflammatory and may be red, pus-filled, and painful.

The treatment of acne comprises topical, systemic, and lifestyle remedies. Topical remedies include prescribed ointments or cleansers. Systemic therapy consists of antibiotics or hormonal preparations to keep acne at bay. Lifestyle changes for acne majorly include a clean diet, better hydration, and regular exercise. Timely treatment of acne can greatly help prevent acne scars in the future.

SYMPTOMS OF ACNE
Symptoms Of Acne
Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a recurrent skin condition. In this, the pores and hair follicles of the skin get clogged with sebum. Acne can be seen in the form of pimples, blackheads or comedones, or nodes of the skin. Following are the symptoms of acne:


Reddened and painful skin around the acne spots
Skin that may become darker or scarred over time
Fever and joint pain may occur in rare but severe cases of acne

Some symptoms based on the type of acne are:
1. Comedogenic acne (Non-inflammatory acne)
Closed comedones (whiteheads):These are small round lesions that contain whitish material (sebum and dead skin cells).
Open comedones (blackheads):These small round lesions appear as bumpy dark spots.
2. Non-comedogenic acne (Inflammatory acne)
This acne appears as a red and painful area on the skin.
They are small, reddish bumps that may or may not be filled with pus developed from comedones.

Furthermore, this inflammatory acne can be presented in various forms. The most common ones include:


Papules:These are small painful bumps like eruptions on the skin.
Pustules:These pimples have pus collected in them and are red in color.
Nodules:These are large, painful, solid pimples that are deep in the skin.
Cysts:These deep, painful, pus-filled pimples can cause scars.

In some cases, a person may also suffer from a severe form of acne known as nodulocystic acne. In this, knots are formed on the skin that are hardened masses, larger than 5 mm, and usually present in the area of the back and neck.
CAUSES OF ACNE
Causes Of Acne



The common causes of acne are:


1. HORMONAL CONDITIONS
1. Hormonal conditions
Androgens are hormones that increase in boys and girls during puberty and cause the sebaceous glands to enlarge and make more sebum. Hormone changes during midlife, particularly in women, like PCOS and pregnancy, can also lead to acne breakouts. The menstrual cycle is one of the prime causes of hormonal acne seen in women.

2. GENETIC FACTORS
2. Genetic factors
The genes may be somewhat responsible for the development, course, and severity of acne. Although acne is not the result of a single gene but a series of different genes.

3. ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
3. Environmental factors
Environmental factors, such as sunlight, can worsen acne, along with skin aging. Also, climatic conditions, such as humid weather, can aggravate acne problems in certain individuals due to the overstimulation of sebaceous glands.

4. LIFESTYLE FACTORS
4. Lifestyle factors
Certain food products, such as dairy, products made from dairy, and sugary foods, can cause acne. Also, stress and increased weight are two major causes of acne in many individuals.

5. HEALTH CONDITIONS
5. Health conditions
Certain metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, may cause acne in some individuals. Also, the use of some medications, such as lithium, corticosteroids, or testosterone-containing tablets and creams can result in acne.

6. CHEMICALS/PRODUCTS
6. Chemicals/products
The application of perfumed products, such as cosmetics, hair products, and soaps, can result in acne in some individuals. Irritation of the affected skin area by either scratching, pulling, pressing, or wearing tight garments, such as headbands or scarves around the face and neck, can also cause acne.

PREVENTION OF ACNE
Prevention Of Acne



Acne may seem like a non-serious issue but can affect an individual's confidence and lead to self-consciousness, anxiety, depression, and lower self-esteem. If you suffer from acne frequently, here are some of the preventive tips to avoid acne breakouts:

Wash your face after sweating:If you sweat after going out or wearing a hat or helmet, it can worsen your acne. Hence, it is advised to wash your skin as soon as possible after sweating.

Stay away from irritating scrubs:It is advised to use your fingertips to apply a gentle, non-abrasive cleanser, rather than using a mesh sponge or an abrasive cloth that can irritate the skin.

Be kind to your skin:It is advised to use gentle products, which are alcohol-free. Products like astringents, scrubs, and exfoliants may irritate your skin and therefore, should not be used if you suffer from acne.

Use lukewarm water to clean your face:It is advised to rinse your face with lukewarm water after face wash. Avoid too cold or hot water if you have acne.

Shampoo regularly:If you have oily hair, it could be the reason for acne on your forehead; therefore, it is advised to shampoo daily to get rid of the excess oil.

Let your skin heal the natural way:Do not pop, pick, or squeeze your acne. This would not only worsen your acne problem but your skin will also take longer to heal. This also increases the risk of scarring.

Stop touching your face:Your hands carry germs, which transfer to your face when you touch it, and can cause flare-ups.

Be careful of sun and tanning:Sun is not your best friend, especially when it comes to skin conditions. Tanning damages your skin and certain acne medications make the skin quite sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) light.


DIET & ACNE
Diet & Acne
Certain foods are known to promote inflammation in the body, thereby resulting in acne outbreaks. In addition to that, diet can also affect hormone levels, making your acne worse. Following food items can cause acne breakouts:
Foods that are high in fat content, for example, milk and meat
Foods and beverages with a high sugar content lead to high insulin levels, altering other hormones that can cause acne
Fast foods and snacks

In some patients, chocolate consumption was related to past or current acne. Therefore, it is advised to eat healthily and stay away from foods that could trigger your acne. Consult your dermatologist or a nutritionist to know what foods to avoid in order to achieve better and clear skin.

COMPLICATIONS OF ACNE
Complications Of Acne


Acne, when ignored for a long, can become severe and ultimately lead to scar formation. Some common complications include:

1. Scars:Pitted skin (acne scars) and thick scars (keloids) can remain for a long time after the acne has healed. Scars left by acne can affect both teenagers and adults. Scars are a result of acne breakouts, penetrating deep into the skin layers. The longer someone has inflammatory acne, the higher it is likely to develop acne scars. Therefore, it is best to seek timely treatment for this condition and prevent the formation of acne scars.


2. Skin changes:After acne has cleared, the affected skin may be darker (hyperpigmented) or lighter (hypopigmented) than before.

3. Emotional well-being:Acne can affect more than just skin. It can have a significant impact on one’s emotional well-being. According to studies, acne can lead to low self-esteem, poor self-image, anxiety, depression, decreased quality of life, and feeling alone. Moreover, severe and chronic acne can also take a toll on confidence.

HOME-CARE FOR ACNE
Home-care For Acne


Medications, therapies, and treatments can give long-lasting results; however, it is important to take care of your skin at home too. Below mentioned are some tips to follow at home if you have acne:


Be gentle with your skin:Use a mild cleanser in the morning and evening. Avoid scrubbing your skin as it can worsen your acne.

Avoid certain products:Products such as facial scrubs, astringents, and masks tend to irritate the skin, especially sensitive skin, which can worsen acne. Excessive washing and scrubbing can also irritate the skin.


Refrain from touching your skin too often:People who squeeze, pinch, or pick their pimples can get scars or dark spots on their skin.


Shave carefully:Men and women both can use this tip while shaving facial hair. Men should soften their beards with some soap and water before applying the shaving cream, and the same applies to women too. Facial hairs are delicate and pre-softening is required before shaving. Shave lightly and only when you have to.


Avoid over-exposure to the sun:Many acne medications can make the skin prone to sunburn. Consult a doctor to know more about the reaction of the cream to sun rays.


Choose your makeup carefully:Use oil-free makeup. Look for the word “non-comedogenic” on the label. A ‘non-comedogenic’ label means that the product will not clog up the pores.


Use medications wisely:If the doctor has recommended any treatment plan for acne, it is important to give the treatment some time to show effective results. If acne treatment works, some improvements might be noticed within 4 to 6 weeks. It might take more than 3 months for the skin to clear up.


Avoid using different products all at once:Do not use a new acne product every week as this can irritate the skin and cause fresh breakouts, making it difficult to treat the condition.
