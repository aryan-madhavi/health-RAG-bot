G6PD DEFICIENCY
G6PD DeficiencyAlso known as Deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and G6GDD.
OVERVIEW
Overview

G6PD deficiency is a genetic condition in which the body lacks enough of an enzyme (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) that helps protect red blood cells. It is caused by mutations in the G6PD gene and can lead to red blood cell breakdown when exposed to certain triggers, such as infections, certain foods (e.g., fava beans), or medications.

It is more common in males. Other risk factors include African, Mediterranean, or Asian ethnicity, and having a family history of the condition. People with G6PD deficiency generally remain asymptomatic throughout their lifetime unless exposed to certain triggers.

Symptoms include fatigue,neonatal jaundice(yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes in newborns), and chronic non-spherocytic anemia (destruction of premature red blood cells).

G6PD deficiency cannot be prevented since it's genetic, but its effects can be fully avoided by staying away from certain drugs and foods.

TYPES OF G6PD DEFICIENCY
Types Of G6PD Deficiency

The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies G6PD deficiency into categories based on residual enzyme activity and associated hemolysis risk:

CLASS A (CHRONIC, CNSHA)
Class A (Chronic, CNSHA)
Median G6PD activity is  less than 20%
Chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia is seen
This class includes severe, chronic hemolytic anemia typically seen in certain populations.


CLASS B (ACUTE, TRIGGERED)
Class B (Acute, Triggered)
Median G6PD activity is less than 45%
Acute, triggered type of hemolysis
Individuals with Class B experience hemolysis triggered by factors like infections or certain medications.


CLASS C (NO HEMOLYSIS)
Class C (No Hemolysis)
Median G6PD activity is between 60% and 150%
There is no hemolysis
These individuals generally do not exhibit symptoms, even with exposure to triggers.


CLASS U (UNCERTAIN CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE)
Class U (Uncertain Clinical Significance)
Median G6PD activity can be of any level
New or uncertain variants with unclear impacts on hemolysis.

SYMPTOMS OF G6PD DEFICIENCY
Symptoms Of G6PD Deficiency

Individuals with G6PD deficiency remain asymptomatic throughout their lifetime until they are exposed to an external agent that triggers clinical manifestations.

When exposed to triggers, G6PD deficient are at risk of the following conditions:
Hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells)
Neonatal jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eye due to the deposition of a pigment called bilirubin in newborns) usually appears within 24 hours after birth.
Chronic spherocytic anemia (premature destruction of red blood cells)

The signs and symptoms of these conditions include:
Dark coloured urine
Pale skin
Lethargy
Fever
Weakness
Dizziness
Confusion
Trouble with physical activity
Enlarged spleen and liver
Increased heart rate

Some persons may have right upper quadrant tenderness due to increased bilirubin (pigment produced due to the breakdown of red blood cells).

The high level of bilirubin is a maker of several disorders such as jaundice, anemia, and liver disease. Get your bilirubin level checked if you are noticing the above symptoms.

CAUSES OF G6PD DEFICIENCY
Causes Of G6PD Deficiency

To understand the cause let us first understand what is G6PD:

G6PD stands for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme in nearly all body cells.
It helps protect cells from reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are unstable molecules that can cause cell damage.
G6PD produces glutathione, an antioxidant that neutralizes ROS.
Red blood cells, being involved in oxygen transport, are more vulnerable to ROS damage, and G6PD helps protect them from destruction.

What causes G6PD deficiency?
G6PD is a genetic condition that is present from birth.
There is a gene Gd that codes for this enzyme.
Studies suggest that the deficiency of G6PD is due to the mutations (changes in the gene) that are responsible for the production of G6PD. This change can lead to either:
Reduced activity of the enzyme
Reduce the amount of the enzyme.
RISK FACTORS FOR G6PD DEFICIENCY
Risk Factors For G6PD Deficiency

The most common risk factors include:
1. INGESTION OF FAVA BEANS
1. Ingestion of fava beans
These beans contain oxidizing agents that cause severe oxidative stress in G6PD-deficient individuals, leading to massive hemolysis.

Interesting fact!
Even newborn babies can develop favism through exposure to fava beans by breast milk. Such babies can develop neonatal jaundice if they are inherently G6PD deficient.

Here are 7 things that you must be aware of about breastfeeding.

DIAGNOSIS OF G6PD DEFICIENCY
Diagnosis Of G6PD Deficiency

The following diagnostic approaches are used to confirm hemolysis and G6PD deficiency:


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Physical examination
The first approach is looking for signs and symptoms such as the color of the skin.
This is usually done in newborns to look for signs of jaundice.


MEDICAL HISTORY
Medical history
The knowledge of detailed medical history plays a very important role in diagnosing hemolysis and other outcomes as a result of G6PD deficiency. The clinician enquires about:

Family history of G6PD deficiency
Ethnicity
Medications taken by the person
Previous or recent infection
Recent consumption of fava beans

FLUORESCENT SPOT TEST (FST)
Fluorescent spot test (FST)
It is a first-line diagnostic tool that is used to detect G6PD deficiency in suspected individuals.
The test involves placing a small amount of blood with glucose-6-phosphate and a substrate reagent (a substance that reacts with an enzyme).
Once dried, the spots are viewed under long-wave ultraviolet (UV) light.

BLOOD TESTS
Blood tests
The breakdown of red blood cells will lead to the release of several substances in the blood. This can be confirmed by following blood tests:
Complete blood count(CBC):It helps detect G6PD deficiency by identifying signs of hemolysis, such as low red blood cell count, and hemoglobin levels.
Total serum bilirubin:It helps detect G6PD deficiency by indicating elevated levels due to increased red blood cell breakdown (hemolysis).
Reticulocyte count:It helps detect G6PD deficiency by showing elevated levels as the body produces more immature red blood cells to compensate for hemolysis.
SGOT (Serum Glutamic-Oxaloacetic Transaminase):Also known as AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase), is an enzyme found in the liver, heart, and muscles. It helps assess liver or muscle damage, which can indicate complications during severe hemolysis in G6PD deficiency.
Lactate dehydrogenase:It helps in G6PD deficiency diagnosis by indicating increased levels due to red blood cell destruction during hemolysis.
Serum haptoglobin level:These levels decrease in G6PD deficiency due to binding with free hemoglobin released during red blood cell destruction, helping assess hemolysis severity.
Peripheral blood smear:It is done in G6PD deficiency to visually detect abnormal red blood cells, such as bite cells or Heinz bodies, indicating hemolysis.


URINE TEST
Urine test
It involves examination of urine to look for signs of hemolysis such as the presence of blood in the urine detecting hemosiderin (a form of storage iron derived from the breakdown of red blood cells).
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND
Abdominal ultrasound
It is useful in detecting splenomegaly (enlargement of spleen) and gallstones.
These complications are typically limited to patients with severe chronic hemolysis.

SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC ANALYSIS
Spectrophotometric analysis
This involves measuring the activity of enzymes by using hemolysate in the blood
(resulting product from the lysis of RBCs).
The blood sample is exposed to UV light and the absorbance is measured.

TREATMENT OF G6PD DEFICIENCY
Treatment Of G6PD Deficiency

Most individuals don't need treatment for G6PD deficiency, but symptoms can be prevented by avoiding oxidative triggers like fava beans and certain medications. Symptomatic management includes:
PHOTOTHERAPY
Phototherapy
It is recommended in infants with prolonged neonatal jaundice to prevent brain damage. This includes keeping the infant under fluorescent lamps.
It is a safe and effective method for decreasing or preventing the rise of serum unconjugated bilirubin levels.

FLUID THERAPY
Fluid therapy
It primarily focuses on maintaining hydration
It is recommended in individuals having inadequate blood supply to organs as a result of severe hemolysis.
This helps in preventing hemodynamic shock (when the body doesn't get enough blood flow).


FOLIC ACID (VITAMIN B9) SUPPLEMENTS
Folic acid (Vitamin B9) supplements
Individuals with chronic hemolysis or non-spherocytic anemia are recommended to take folic acid supplements.
This helps in compensating the lost blood since folic acid helps in the synthesis of blood.
