VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY
Vitamin A deficiency
OVERVIEW
Overview
Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that has a primary role in vision. It is also required for proper functioning of the immune system along with overall growth and development. Vitamin A deficiency occurs when the body lacks sufficient amounts of Vitamin A.

The primary cause of Vitamin A deficiency is insufficient dietary intake. Children and pregnant women are more prone to this deficiency due to the more requirements. The symptoms include impaired sensitivity of the eye to light, vision problems, dry skin, growth retardation (in children) and fatigue.

Vitamin A deficiency can be easily corrected through diet and supplementation. Rich sources of Vitamin A include green leafy vegetables, eggs, milk, cheese, tomatoes, mango, papaya, sweet potato and chicken.

SYMPTOMS OF VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY
Symptoms Of Vitamin A deficiency

Vitamin A deficiency can lead to following symptoms:
Impaired sensitivity of the eye to light
Impaired vision in the dark
Vision loss
Blindness
Dryness in the eyes, skin, nails, and lips
Growth retardation
Thickened tongue
Fatigue
Repeated occurrence of infections
Inflammation of the eyelids, surrounding, and even eyes
Urinary tract infection


Here are 6 common reasons for recurrent urinary tract infections.
Tap To Know

Severe Vitamin A deficiency can causexerophthalmiawhich can lead to the following symptoms:
Night blindness:Impaired sensitivity of the eye to light
Conjunctival xerosis:Dull, dry, thick, wrinkled appearance of the conjunctiva (thin, clear membrane that protects the eye)
Bitot spots:Whitish, foamy, opaque deposits on the conjunctiva
Corneal xerosis:Dull, dry, and hazy in appearance of cornea (transparent front part of the eye)
Keratomalacia (presence of ulcers and softening of the cornea)
Corneal scars (scarring of the cornea)
Xerophthalmic fundus (structural changes in the back surface of the eye
CAUSES OF VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY
Causes Of Vitamin A deficiency

Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that is required for:
Normal vision
Proper functioning of the immune system
Reproduction
Growth and development

The major function of Vitamin A is maintenance of normal vision. Eyes need certain pigments to see the full spectrum of light. The synthesis of these pigments is halted by a deficiency of Vitamin A. Severe Vitamin A deficiency also leads to improper moisturization of the eye.
WHAT CAN LEAD TO VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY?
What can lead to Vitamin A deficiency?
1. INADEQUATE DIETARY INTAKE OF VITAMIN A
1. Inadequate dietary intake of Vitamin A
Low intake of dietary sources of Vitamin A can be attributed by:
Insufficient dietary intake
Long term alcoholism
Highly selective eating
Difficulty in swallowing
Mental illness

2. IMPAIRED ABSORPTION OF VITAMIN A
2. Impaired absorption of Vitamin A
The absorption of Vitamin A majorly takes place in the upper part of the small intestine. The presence of any diseases affecting the intestine can cause insufficient absorption of Vitamin A and lead to its deficiency.
3. REDUCED STORAGE OF VITAMIN A
3. Reduced storage of Vitamin A
The reduced storage of Vitamin A can also be a cause of its deficiency
Liver diseases
Cystic fibrosis (inherited disorder that mainly affects lungs and digestive system)
RISK FACTORS FOR VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY
Risk Factors For Vitamin A deficiency

The following factors increase the risk of Vitamin A deficiency:
1. AGE
1. Age
Pre-school children are more prone to develop a deficiency of Vitamin A. Studies suggest that the highest prevalence of Vitamin A deficiency is seen in children between 36 to 47 months of age.

2. MALNUTRITION OR SEVERELY RESTRICTED DIETS

2. Malnutrition or severely restricted diets
Malnourished individuals and those who follow a severely restricted diet can have multiple vitamin deficiencies including Vitamin A deficiency.
3. ZINC DEFICIENCY
3. Zinc deficiency
Vitamin A is transported throughout the body with the help of zinc. The deficiency of zinc makes the individual more prone to develop Vitamin A deficiency as well.
4. PREGNANCY
4. Pregnancy
Pregnant women are at higher risk of developing Vitamin A deficiency due to the increases in demand.

5. BARIATRIC SURGERY

5. Bariatric surgery
Bariatric surgery, a type of weight loss surgery increases the risk of developing a deficiency of Vitamin A. This is due to the malabsorption of certain vitamins and minerals.

6. CERTAIN MEDICAL CONDITIONS

6. Certain medical conditions
The medical conditions that impair the ability of the intestine to absorb fat along with some infections make the person more likely to develop Vitamin A deficiency.
Such conditions include:
Chronic diarrhea
Celiac disease
Cystic fibrosis
Blockage of bile duct
MeaslesDid you know?

DIAGNOSIS OF VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY
Diagnosis Of Vitamin A deficiency

The diagnosis is made through medical history and physical examination and confirmed by response to vitamin A supplementation.
The various tests used to determine Vitamin A deficiency include:
I. BLOOD TESTS
I. Blood tests
1. Serum retinol:Retinol is the circulating form of Vitamin A. The test measures the amount of retinol in the blood. Blood concentrations of retinol do not reflect exact amounts of Vitamin A. This is due to the maintenance of circulating retinol levels by the liver stores.
However, this test is used to assess subclinical deficiency of Vitamin A. The level less than  <0.70 μmol/L indicates subclinical vitamin A deficiency.
2. Serum retinol-binding protein study
Retinol binding protein is a protein through which retinol transports in the body. This test measures the quantity of this protein through an instrument called a fluorometer.
3. Zinc level
The estimation of zinc is useful since its deficiency is also associated with Vitamin A deficiency.
4. Iron
Individuals with confirmed Vitamin A deficiency are also suggested to detect the level of iron. This is because the deficiency of iron can also affect the metabolism of vitamin A.
5. Complete blood cell count
A complete blood count (CBC) is recommended if there is a possibility of anemia, infection, orsepsis.


Here’s more on what you must know about the CBC test and its various parameters.

6. Electrolyte level
An electrolyte evaluation and liver function studies should be performed to evaluate for nutritional and volume status.
II. IMAGING TESTS
II. Imaging tests
1. X-rays
The radiography of bones is mostly recommended in children for the evaluation of their growth as a result of Vitamin A deficiency.
2. Dark-adaptation threshold (DAT)
It is a vision test that measures the adjustment of the eye after exposing it to the dark.

PREVENTION OF VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY
Prevention Of Vitamin A deficiency

The deficiency of Vitamin A can be prevented by the following measures:
1. ENCOURAGING BREASTFEEDING
1. Encouraging breastfeeding
Newborns are generally born with very low levels of Vitamin A. Breast milk serves as an excellent source of Vitamin A, especially during the initial six months of life. It is seen that children who get exclusively breast milk for the first 6 months have lesser chances of developing Vitamin A deficiency later in life.
Postpartum women should take Vitamin A-rich foods or supplements if needed. It proves to be beneficial to have a good content of Vitamin A in breast milk.
