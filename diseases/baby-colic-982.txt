BABY COLIC
Baby colicAlso known as Colic in babies, Infant colic or Infantile colic.
OVERVIEW
Overview

Colic is referred to as long stretches of intense crying in otherwise healthy infants for more than 3 hours a day at least 3 days per week for more than 3 weeks.

It is most common during the first 6 weeks of life and tends to resolve on its own by age 3 to 4 months. Some of the common signs and symptoms of infantile colic include inconsolable crying, clenching of fists and legs, arching of the back, difficulty sleeping, and difficulty feeding.

The exact cause of infantile colic is not fully known. However, it is commonly associated with an immature digestive system, food sensitivities or allergies, swallowing air while feeding, or changes in formula or feeding patterns.

There is no specific cure for infantile colic. However, a few remedies include soothing techniques, such as rocking or swaddling, eliminating certain allergic foods from the breastfeeding mother’s diet, and medications, such as simethicone drops or probiotics.

Remember that colic is a self limiting, episodic and transient condition that normally goes away on its own after a few months. In the meantime, try to be patient and concentrate on taking care of yourself and your kid.

SYMPTOMS OF BABY COLIC
Symptoms Of Baby Colic

It’s normal for babies to fuss and cry. Babies who have colic tend to cry more than other babies, even though they’re otherwise healthy. Features of colic can include:

Intense and incessant crying episodes (lasting for usually more than 3 hours) even in the absence of triggers like hunger or need of diaper change.
Crying at the same time(s) everyday. Colicky babies mostly get fussy towards the end of the day. However, crying can happen at any time.
Clenching their fists, raising their legs above and tightening their abdominal muscles while crying.
Crying is loud, piercing and ceaseless in nature like they’re in pain.
Turning bright red when crying.
An increase in bowel activity may also be observed. They may break wind (pass gas) or spit up.

CAUSES OF BABY COLIC
Causes Of Baby Colic


Colic usually starts in the second or third week of life, peaks around 6 weeks, and resolves by the age of 12 weeks in 60%  and by 16 weeks of age in 90% of infants.

The exact cause of colic is not fully understood, but there are several factors that are believed to contribute or trigger to this condition:

1. DIGESTIVE ISSUES IN THE INFANT
1. Digestive issues in the infant
Intolerance to lactose or cow's milk protein
Sensitivity to food in the breastfeeding mother's diet
Excessive gassiness or gas production
An immature digestive system
Acid reflux
Swallowing air
Overfeeding or underfeeding
Insufficient burping

2. EXPOSURE TO MEDICATIONS THROUGH BREAST FEEDING
2. Exposure to medications through breast feeding
Caffeine and nicotine in breast milk have been related to infant irritability because the baby's body is unable to adequately eliminate these toxins.
Certain medications are also passed through breast milk. If you are breastfeeding, discuss your medications with your doctor.

3. NEURODEVELOPMENTAL ISSUES
3. Neurodevelopmental issues
Higher level of serotonin (a key hormone that can stabilize mood)
An immature nervous system
Infant temperament
An early form of childhood migraine

To diagnose colic in infants, doctors typically rely on a set of criteria known as the "Rule of Three." These are some of the criteria-

Symptoms persist for more than 3 hours a day
Happens more than 3 days a week
Persisting for more than 3 weeks

If an infant meets these criteria, a doctor may diagnose them with colic. However, before making a diagnosis, the pediatrician will do a physical exam and review your baby’s history and symptoms.
The doctor might perform some tests to rule out other medical conditions that can cause similar symptoms.
