PNEUMONIA
PneumoniaAlso known as Lung infection, Also known as Respiratory infection, Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), and Bronchopneumonia
OVERVIEW
Overview
Pneumonia is an infection that causes inflammation in the air sacs of one or both lungs. These air sacs may fill with fluid or pus, leading to symptoms such as acoughwith phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi, with Streptococcus pneumoniae being the most common bacterial cause.

The illness can range from mild to life-threatening, with the most serious cases occurring in infants, older adults, and individuals with weakened immune systems or chronic health conditions.

The good news is that pneumonia is often preventable. Vaccines, especially the influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, can significantly reduce the risk. Practicing good hand hygiene, avoiding smoking, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle also help protect the lungs and prevent infection.

Treatment usually includes rest, fluids, and antibiotics or antivirals. In severe cases, hospitalization, oxygen therapy, or intravenous medications may be needed, particularly for high-risk individuals or when complications develop.

SYMPTOMS OF PNEUMONIA
Symptoms Of Pneumonia

The signs and symptoms of pneumonia can vary depending on the type of pneumonia, age, and overall health of the person. However, common symptoms include:
Cough(sometimes with mucus)Feverand chillsShortness of breath or difficulty breathingChest painTirednessand weaknessMuscle achesHeadacheNausea,vomiting, or diarrheaLoss of appetite or trouble feeding (especially in infants)Irritability or unusual fussiness (in younger children)

In severe pneumonia, the symptoms become much more intense and may also include:
A bluish color around the lips or nails due to low oxygen levelsConfusion or disorientationLow blood pressure, leading to dizziness or fainting.



If any of these symptoms are severe or persistent, it’s important to seek medical attention quickly.

CAUSES OF PNEUMONIA
Causes Of Pneumonia

Pneumonia can be caused by various infectious agents that enter the lungs and lead to inflammation of the air sacs (alveoli). The main causes include:

Bacteria:The most common cause, especially Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other bacterial causes include Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.


Viruses:Viruses like the flu, COVID-19, or RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) can cause pneumonia, especially in children and older adults.


Fungi:People with weak immune systems or long-term health problems may get pneumonia from certain fungi in the environment.


Aspiration:Sometimes, food, drink, or vomit accidentally goes into the lungs instead of the stomach, leading to pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia is more common in alcoholics, comatose patients, or those with brain injury or swallowing difficulties.


Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP):Also known as nosocomial pneumonia, some people get pneumonia during hospital stays, especially if they are using a breathing machine or have been sick for a long time. HAP is often more resistant to antibiotics.


Pneumonia spreads through airborne droplets released when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Inhaling these droplets can lead to a lung infection. It may also spread through saliva or blood contact in some cases.Did you know?
Atypical pneumonia, also known as walking pneumonia, is a condition in which pneumonia isn't severe enough to require bed rest or hospitalization. Many people with atypical pneumonia continue daily activities without realizing they are ill, hence the term “walking pneumonia.” It is often seen in younger people and spreads easily in close-contact settings like schools, dorms, or military barracks.


RISK FACTORS FOR PNEUMONIA
Risk Factors For Pneumonia

Certain factors can increase the likelihood of developing pneumonia. These include:
Age:Children under 5 and adults over 65 are more vulnerable to pneumonia because their immune systems may not be as strong.

Weakened immune system:Conditions like HIV/AIDS, cancer treatments (e.g., chemotherapy), or medications that suppress the immune system (such as corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs) can increase the risk of pneumonia.

Chronic diseases:Chronic conditions such as lung diseases (e.g.,asthma, COPD,  COPD, cystic fibrosis, orlung cancer), heart diseases, anddiabetesweaken the body’s ability to fight infections, making individuals more prone to pneumonia.

Smoking:Smoking damages the lungs, impairing their ability to clear infections and increasing vulnerability to pneumonia.

Recent viral infections:Having a viral infection like theinfluenza (flu)or cold can weaken the lungs’ defense against bacterial infections, making it easier for pneumonia to develop afterward.

Hospitalization:People who are hospitalized, especially those on ventilators or with serious health conditions, are at higher risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), which is often caused by more resistant bacteria.
Swallowing difficulties:Conditions like astroke, neurological disorders, or difficulty swallowing can cause food, liquid, or saliva to enter the lungs, leading to aspiration pneumonia.Did You Know?
Air pollution can also increase the risk of pneumonia by causing inflammation in the airways and weakening the immune system. It reduces the lungs’ ability to clear out harmful germs, making individuals more prone to serious lung infections like pneumonia.

DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA
Diagnosis Of Pneumonia

Pneumonia is diagnosed through a combination of clinical evaluation and diagnostic tests, including:

1. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
1. Physical Examination
A doctor listens to breathing sounds using a stethoscope to detect any abnormal lung sounds.
They also check for symptoms such as fever, cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath.


2. IMAGING TESTS
2. Imaging Tests
Chest X-ray:Most commonly used imaging test for diagnosing pneumonia. It helps assess severity and which areas of the lung are affected.
Chest CT Scan (Computed Tomography):Provides more detailed images than a chest X-ray.


3. LABORATORY TESTS
3. Laboratory Tests
Complete Blood Count (CBC):Helps in identifying infection, guiding further testing, and monitoring the progress of treatment.
Sputum Examination:Identifies the bacteria or virus causing pneumonia.
Blood cultures:Detects if the infection has spread to the blood (sepsis risk).
Urine tests:Urinary antigen tests (UATs) help diagnose certain types of pneumonia, particularly those caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila.
Inflammatory markers:Markers likeCRPandProcalcitoninhelp determine severity and guide antibiotic use.

4. PULSE OXIMETRY / ABG
4. Pulse Oximetry / ABG
Pulse oximetry:Measures blood oxygen levels; low levels may indicate impaired lung function.
Arterial blood gases (ABG):Used in severe cases to assess oxygen and carbon dioxide levels.

5. ADDITIONAL TESTS (IF NEEDED)
5. Additional Tests (if needed)
Pleural fluid analysis:If fluid is present around the lungs (pleural effusion).
Rapid viral tests:For flu, COVID-19, or RSV detection.

PREVENTION OF  PNEUMONIA
Prevention Of  Pneumonia

Pneumonia can often be prevented with simple, effective measures:

1. GET VACCINATED
1. Get vaccinated
Pneumococcal vaccines protect against the most common bacterial cause.
Children:In India, the Pneumococcal Vaccine is a critical part of the National Immunization Programme, aiming to reduce child mortality from pneumonia and other pneumococcal diseases. The vaccine is administered to children under the age of five.
Adults:Adults 50 and older and those aged 19-49 with specific risk conditions are advised to get this pneumococcal vaccine.

It is recommended to consult with a doctor to ensure you or your child receives the pneumococcal vaccine as per the appropriate schedule.
Speak To A Doctor
Flu vaccineshelp prevent viral infections that can lead to pneumonia. Everyone above 6 months of age, including adults and children, is advised to get vaccinated against the flu every year.

The COVID-19 vaccinemay also reduce pneumonia risk.

Get vaccinated against pneumonia from the comfort of your home.

Did You Know?
Breastfeeding can lower the chances of pneumonia in kids.
Research indicates that exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months of life, along with continued breastfeeding up to 24 months, can significantly reduce the risk of pneumonia in infants and young children. This protective effect is largely due to the presence of numerous immunoprotective and immune-boosting compounds naturally found in breast milk.

COMPLICATIONS OF PNEUMONIA
Complications Of Pneumonia

The various complications of pneumonia include:

Pleural effusion:Buildup of fluid between the layers of tissue lining the lungs and chest cavity.


Lung abscess: Pus-filled cavity in the lung due to severe infection.


Sepsis:A life-threatening body-wide response to infection.


Respiratory failure:Lungs cannot deliver enough oxygen or remove carbon dioxide.


Empyema:Collection of pus in the pleural space (around the lungs).


Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS):Severe inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs.


Chronic lung damage:In some cases, pneumonia can cause scarring or long-term lung problems, especially if recurrent.

Pneumothorax (Collapsed lung):Air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall.


Bronchiectasis:Permanent widening and damage to airways from repeated or severe infections.


Myocarditis/ Pericarditis:Inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or the surrounding sac (pericarditis) due to infection spread.


Encephalopathy or delirium:Especially in older adults, pneumonia can cause confusion, memory issues, or delirium.


Multisystem organ failure:In severe cases like sepsis or ARDS, pneumonia can cause the failure of organs such as the kidneys, liver, or heart.


Secondary infections:Patients with pneumonia may develop secondary bacterial infections like meningitis, ear infections, or sinusitis.
