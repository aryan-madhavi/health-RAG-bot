GRAVES DISEASE
Graves Disease
OVERVIEW
Overview
Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder where the thyroid gland becomes overactive, leading to an excess of thyroid hormones. This condition mainly affects women under 40 but can occur at any age. Common symptoms include weight loss, rapid heartbeat, tremors, fatigue, and heat intolerance. A notable sign of Graves' disease is bulging eyes, known as Graves' ophthalmopathy.

While the exact cause of Graves' disease is not fully understood, it is thought to arise from a mix of genetic, environmental, and immune system factors. Diagnosis typically involves blood tests to check thyroid hormone levels and imaging to assess the thyroid gland's condition.

Effective management of Graves' disease is essential for maintaining health and well-being. Treatment options include medications to control hormone levels, radioactive iodine therapy to reduce thyroid activity, and sometimes surgery to remove part or all of the thyroid gland. With proper treatment and consistent care, individuals with Graves' disease can live full and healthy lives.

SYMPTOMS OF GRAVES DISEASE
Symptoms Of Graves disease

Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that often presents symptoms of hyperthyroidism, along with effects on the eyes and skin. Symptoms can vary over time.


1. Hyperthyroidism symptoms


Rapid or irregular heartbeat
Tremors, muscle weakness
Sleep issues, nervousness
Weight loss despite normal eating habits
Excessive sweating, heat intolerance
Frequent bowel movements
Enlarged thyroid gland (goitre)


2. Skin symptoms


Reddish, thickened skin (Graves' dermopathy)
Rough skin texture, primarily on the shins
Mild and painless in most cases


3. Ophthalmic symptoms


Eye inflammation or redness
Tissue swelling
Gritty, irritated eyes
Swollen or puffy eyes
Sensitivity to light
Eye pressure or pain
Blurred or double vision
Protruding or bulging eyes

Note:About 30% of those with Graves’ disease develop Graves’ ophthalmopathy (GO) because the antibodies that attack the thyroid also attack the eyes.

CAUSES OF GRAVES DISEASE
Causes Of Graves disease

Graves' disease is an autoimmune condition where the immune system overproduces an antibody called thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI). Instead of protecting the body, this antibody mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, causing it to become overactive. As a result, the thyroid produces excessive thyroid hormones, leading to hyperthyroidism.


The exact cause of Graves' disease remains unknown, but certain factors may increase the risk of developing this condition. Further details on these risk factors will be discussed in the next segment.

RISK FACTORS FOR GRAVES DISEASE
Risk Factors For Graves disease

Several factors contribute to the risk of developing Graves' disease. These include:

Demographic factors:
Gender: Women are at a significantly higher risk compared to men.
Age: Individuals aged 30 or above are more susceptible.
Postpartum period:Women are particularly vulnerable after childbirth.

Genetic factors:
Family history:A family history of Graves' disease, Hashimoto's disease, or other autoimmune disorders increases risk.
Down syndrome:Children with Down syndrome are at a higher risk.
DiGeorge syndrome:Children with DiGeorge syndrome are also more susceptible.

Environmental factors:
Infections:Bacterial and viral infections may trigger autoimmune responses.
Iodine exposure:Elevated levels of iodine can predispose individuals.
Smoking:Tobacco use increases the risk.
Stress:Significant stress can trigger the onset.
Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART):Individuals undergoing this treatment face increased risk.

Autoimmune conditions:
Rheumatoid Arthritis
Type 1 Diabetes
AutoimmuneGastritis
Vitiligo
DIAGNOSIS OF GRAVES DISEASE
Diagnosis Of Graves disease

Graves' disease diagnosis involves a series of steps:
1. Medical history and physical examination
The doctor assesses symptoms, medical history, and family background. Physical exams may reveal signs like an enlarged thyroid gland (goitre), eye changes (such as bulging eyes or eyelid retraction), and skin changes.
2.Thyroid function tests
Blood tests measure levels of thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). In Graves' disease, T4 and T3 levels are typically high, while TSH levels are low or undetectable due to excessive thyroid hormone production.
3.Thyroid antibody tests
Blood tests detect specific antibodies associated with Graves' disease, confirming its autoimmune nature such as thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) or thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb).
4.Radioactive Iodine Uptake (RAIU) test
The radioactive iodine uptake test evaluates the quantity of iodine absorbed by your thyroid gland from your blood to produce thyroid hormones. Elevated iodine uptake may indicate the presence of Graves' disease.

5.Thyroid Ultrasonogramwith doppler
This imaging technique identifies increased blood flow in the thyroid caused by Graves’ disease. It may be preferred over RAIU during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

6. T3/T4 ratio orFT3/FT4ratio
Ratios exceeding specific thresholds can suggest Graves' disease, providing additional diagnostic insight into the condition's hormonal profile and helping differentiate it from other thyroid disorders.
7.Complete blood tests
To check for related conditions like anemia, liver damage, hypercalcemia, andlipid profilechanges.
7. Imaging testsUltrasonography:Preferred over scintigraphy to avoid radiation. Shows an enlarged, hyperechoic, hypervascular thyroid gland.

Scintigraphy:Displays uniform isotope uptake and diffuse enlargement of thyroid lobes. Helps in identifying non-autoimmune causes of hyperthyroidism, such as an autonomous 'hot' nodule.

CT or MRI of orbits:These imaging tests can help diagnose Graves orbitopathy in patients who show symptoms related to the eyes but don't have an overactive thyroid.
