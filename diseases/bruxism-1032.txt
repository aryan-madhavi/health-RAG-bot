BRUXISM
BruxismAlso known as Teeth grinding and Clenching
OVERVIEW
Overview

Bruxism is a condition marked by the habitual grinding or clenching of teeth, typically occurring during sleep. Bruxism is prevalent across various age groups, with both adults and children affected.

Bruxism often goes unnoticed until symptoms like tooth wear or jaw discomfort arise.
Risk factors for bruxism includestress,anxiety, sleep disorders, and lifestyle habits like caffeine or alcohol consumption. Additionally, certain medications and a family history of bruxism can increase the likelihood of developing this condition. Bruxism is generally seen equally in both men and women, although some studies suggest it might be slightly more common in women.

Nightguards or splints are commonly prescribed to protect teeth from further damage. Stress management techniques and behavioral therapies may be recommended to address underlying causes. Regular dental check-ups are crucial for early detection and intervention.

TYPES OF BRUXISM
Types of Bruxism

Bruxism exhibits a wide variety of classifications, with the common types being:

1. Sleep bruxism (SB)
Involves involuntary grinding or clenching of teeth during sleep.
Characterized as rhythmic (phasic) or non-rhythmic (tonic).
Potential contributing factors: stress, sleep disorders, dental issues.

2. Awake bruxism (AB)
Characterized by grinding or clenching teeth while conscious.
Occurs during heightened stress, anxiety, or concentration.
CAUSES OF BRUXISM
Causes Of Bruxism

While stress and anxiety are known to trigger bruxism, the exact cause may vary from person to person. However, several risk factors can contribute to bruxism which are discussed in the next segment.

RISK FACTORS FOR BRUXISM
Risk Factors For Bruxism

Many risk factors can lead to bruxism. They include:
1. MALOCCLUSION (TEETH MISALIGNMENT)
1. Malocclusion (Teeth misalignment)
Misalignment of the teeth (malocclusion) or improper bite can contribute to bruxism as the jaw seeks a comfortable resting position.


Even teeth not only enhance your appearance but can also prevent a lot of oral issues. Consult a specialist to understand this better.

DIAGNOSIS OF BRUXISM
Diagnosis Of Bruxism

Effectively diagnosing bruxism poses unique challenges for physicians, often relying on a combination of self-reports, oral history, and clinical examinations.
To ensure accuracy, the process involves the following:
1. HISTORY
1. History
Physicians employ questionnaires and interviews to gather information about symptoms, habits, and potential triggers for teeth grinding or clenching.

2. EXTERNAL OBSERVATIONS
2. External observations
Input from parents (in the case of children) or partners can offer valuable insights into behaviors, especially during sleep.

3. CLINICAL EXAMINATION
3. Clinical examination
Dentists and healthcare professionals conduct a thorough examination, assessing signs of bruxism such as tooth wear, jaw tenderness, and muscle pain.
Understanding the patient's dental history is crucial during this examination.


4. INSTRUMENTAL MEASUREMENTS
4. Instrumental measurements
Electromyographic (EMG) recordings:EMG recordings are valuable for assessing muscle activity during both awake and sleep bruxism.


Polysomnography:An overnight study monitoring various physiological parameters (like brain activity, eye movements, muscle activity, heart rate, oxygen levels etc.) during sleep is conclusive for diagnosing sleep bruxism.


Audio and video recordings:These supplementary recordings, especially during sleep, can provide additional information to support the diagnosis.

5. APP-BASED ASSESSMENTS
5. App-based assessments
Real-time information about awake muscle activity obtained through app-based assessments can contribute additional evidence for diagnosing awake bruxism.

6. GRADING SYSTEM (LOBBEZOO ET AL.)
6. Grading system (Lobbezoo et al.)
The grading system proposed by Lobbezoo et al. categorizes bruxism diagnosis into three levels:


Possible: Based on self-report only.
Probable: Combines self-report with clinical examination.
Definite: Involves self-reporting, clinical inspection, and polysomnographic recording, ideally supported by audio and video recordings, particularly for sleep bruxism.

TREATMENT OF BRUXISM
Treatment Of Bruxism

The treatment of bruxism aims to alleviate symptoms, prevent further damage to the teeth, and address underlying causes. The approach to treatment may involve a combination of the following strategies:
I. ORAL DEVICES
I. Oral devices
1. Custom-fitted mouthguards and SplintsThese are commonly used to protect teeth from nighttime grinding, distributing forces to prevent wear and damage.Hard acrylic-resin stabilization splints are considered more effective than soft alternatives.

2. Mandibular Advancement Device (MAD):MADs, known for addressing chronic snoring and mild obstructive sleep apnea, position the lower jaw forward, helping keep the airway open and, in some cases, reducing teeth grinding.They are recommended when bruxism coincides with sleep apnea.

II. DENTAL CORRECTIONS
II. Dental corrections
In some cases, orthodontic treatments (such as braces or aligners), crowns or overlays, or dental adjustments may be recommended to restore damaged teeth and improve their resilience to grinding forces.

III. CONTINGENT ELECTRICAL STIMULATION (CES)
III. Contingent electrical stimulation (CES)
It intends to decrease masticatory muscle activity (chewing) by applying low-level electrical stimulation during bruxism.
Limited studies; further research is needed to elucidate long-term results.

IV. MEDICATION
IV. Medication
Certain medications are reserved for short periods and severe cases when other approaches are ineffective. Examples of drugs include:
Antianxiety agents:Lorazepam
Tranquilizers:Diazepam
Sedatives:Zolpidem
Muscle relaxants:Cyclobenzaprine
Tricyclic antidepressants:Amitriptyline

V. BOTULIN TOXIN
V. Botulin toxin
Botox injections into the masseter muscles of the jaw help weaken the muscles and prevent involuntary teeth grinding and jaw clenching.
This method is used in more extreme cases of bruxism since it is more effective than other methods like mouth guards.

MANAGEMENT OF BRUXISM IN CHILDREN
Management of Bruxism in Children

1. Multidisciplinary approach
It requires a comprehensive approach that integrates the expertise of healthcare professionals, parents' active involvement, and the child's cooperation.

2. Behavioral interventions
Stress reduction techniques, such as relaxation exercises and creating a calm bedtime routine, can help manage emotional triggers contributing to teeth grinding.

3. Physiotherapy methods
It aims to address muscular aspects of bruxism, promoting relaxation and minimizing the physical manifestations of teeth grinding. Various techniques are employed, including:

Kinesiotherapy: Involves therapeutic exercises to improve muscle function, flexibility, and coordination, targeting the muscles involved in jaw movement.


Massage: Focuses on relaxing tense muscles in the jaw and neck area, reducing overall muscle tension associated with bruxism.


Infrared Therapy: Utilizes infrared light to promote circulation, reduce inflammation, and alleviate muscle discomfort in the jaw.


Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT): Involves the application of low-level lasers to stimulate tissue repair and reduce muscle tension.

COMPLICATIONS OF BRUXISM
Complications Of Bruxism

Bruxism, the habitual grinding or clenching of teeth, can lead to several complications and adverse effects on oral health and overall well-being. Some common complications include:

1. Tooth damage:Persistent grinding can result in the wearing down of tooth enamel (outer layer of the tooth), leading to increased tooth sensitivity, fractures, and even tooth loss in severe cases.

2. Jaw Disorders (TMJ Disorders):Bruxism can contribute to jaw pain, difficulty in jaw movement, and clicking or popping sounds when opening or closing the mouth.

3. Headaches:Chronic bruxism is often associated with tension headaches, as the constant muscle tension and strain in the jaw can radiate pain to the head and neck.

4. Ear Pain andTinnitus:Bruxism can lead to earaches or pain. Additionally, it may induce tinnitus, manifesting as ringing or buzzing sounds in the ears for some individuals.

5. Sleep Disturbances:The grinding noises produced during sleep can disturb a person's sleep or that of their sleep partner, leading to disrupted sleep patterns and fatigue.

6. Facial Muscle Pain:Grinding can cause facial pain, especially around the jaw and temporomandibular joint areas, leading to discomfort and reduced quality of life.

7. Gum Recession:Bruxism can contribute to gum recession, exposing the roots of the teeth and making them more susceptible to decay and sensitivity.
